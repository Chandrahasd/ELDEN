CONTEXT	 NY Times 9/30/01: Fearing Harm, bin Laden Kin Fled From U.S. : " WASHINGTON- In the first days after the terror attacks on New York and Washington, Saudi Arabia supervised the urgent evacuation of 24 members of Osama bin Laden's extended family from the United States, fearing that they might be subjected to violence." Tampabay: TIA now verifies flight of Saudis : "TIA now verifies flight of Saudis. The government has long denied that two days after the 9/11 attacks, the three were allowed to fly." Dark heart of the American dream : "On 11 September, while Al-Qaeda's planes slammed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Carlyle Group hosted a conference at a Washington hotel. Among the guests of honour was a valued investor: Shafig bin Laden, brother to Osama." Bush, Enron, UNOCAL and the Taliban : "The Bush Administration's entanglement with ENRON is beginning to unravel as it finally admits that Enron executives entered the White House six times last year to secretly plan the Administration's energy policy with Vice-President Cheney before the collapse of the Texas-based energy giant. Meanwhile, even more trouble for our former-Texas-oil-man-turned-President is brewing with reports that unveil UNOCAL, another big energy company, for being in bed with the Taliban, along with the U.S. government in a major, continuing effort to construct pipelines through Afghanistan from the petroleum-rich Caspian Basin in Central Asia. Beneath their burkas, UNOCAL is being exposed for giving the five star treatment to Taliban Mullahs in the Lone Star State in 1997. The 'evil-ones' were also invited to meet with U.S. government officials in Washington, D.C." Getting used to the idea of double standards : "The underlying maxim is "we will punish the crimes of our enemies and reward the crimes of our friends". According to Afghan, Iranian, and Turkish government sources, Hamid Karzai, the interim Prime Minister of Afghanistan, was a top adviser to the El Segundo, California-based UNOCAL Corporation which was negotiating with the Taliban to construct a Central Asia Gas (CentGas) pipeline from Turkmenistan through western Afghanistan to Pakistan." Osama bin Laden: The Forbidden Truth : " Some months ago, a book was published in France entitled 'Osama bin Laden: The Forbidden Truth.' The authors, Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasique, described a connection between the September 11th terrorist attacks and a stalled plan to build a pipeline to exploit the vast natural gas fields along the Caspian Sea in Turkmenistan. Their story pointed damning fingers at American petroleum companies and the Bush administration, citing instances where U.S. anti-terrorism efforts were thwarted in order to smooth the way for the pipeline deal."

CONTEXT	 http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=59854 John McCain is Bob Dole minus the charm, conservatism and youth. Like McCain, pollsters assured us that Dole was the most "electable" Republican. Unlike McCain, Dole didn't lie all the time while claiming to engage in Straight Talk. Of course, I might lie constantly too, if I were seeking the Republican presidential nomination after enthusiastically promoting amnesty for illegal aliens, Social Security credit for illegal aliens, criminal trials for terrorists, stem-cell research on human embryos, crackpot global warming legislation and free speech-crushing campaign-finance laws. I might lie too, if I had opposed the Bush tax cuts, a marriage amendment to the Constitution, waterboarding terrorists and drilling in Alaska. And I might lie if I had called the ads of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth "dishonest and dishonorable." Though McCain generally votes pro-life – as his Arizona constituency requires – he embraces the loony lingo of the pro-abortion set, repeatedly assuring his pals in the media that he opposes the repeal of Roe v. Wade because it would force women to undergo "illegal and dangerous operations." To ensure he would get full media coverage for that little gem, McCain alerted the networks in advance that he planned to attack their favorite whipping boys. Newspaper editors across the country stood in awe of McCain's raw bravery. The New York Times praised him in an editorial that said the Republican Party "has for too long been tied to the cramped ideology of the Falwells and the Robertsons." Come to think of it, Dole is a million times better than McCain. Why not run him again? ________________________________________

Horrible. On the other hand, Chief Deputy San Francisco Attorney Therese Stewart was highly articulate and forceful. She rocked. But sadly, I must admit that Ken Starr earned his coin today, he was as smooth as a snake.

"But if the hub goes away, our world will not come to an end." Cox said that if a newly merged airline decides to abandon Memphis as a hub, some other carrier will likely move in to fill much of the void. Memphis is the smallest U.S. market with a hub, Cox said, and the smallest hub that Northwest operates. combined mega-airline begins trying to decide what to do with Trippler agreed with Cox that smaller could be better when a Memphis. "Atlanta is so big. It is so busy," Trippler said. "It may be a situation were they want to keep the Memphis hub going because it siphons off some of the Hartsfield traffic."

Husband and I moved here (near Nederland) from SF a couple of years ago and this winter, I decided to go back to teaching and offering a guide service to Summit/Eagle resorts. I have a long history of teaching sports to the LGBT community, including soccer, tennis and now skiing. Previous winters were spent as a patroller at Alpine Meadows at Lake Tahoe, but I decided to try teaching instead of patrolling this year. I have been getting some pretty good responses and have had happy clients so far. I have several ads on Craigslist and if you want to check one out go to Denver CL and tap in gay ski instrutor under services- lessons.  So, I am curious to see if any of you, your friends, visitors or your Aunt Blanche is interested in lessons or having me show them around the place?

It shouldn't be viewed otherwise," he Prachanda became Nepal's top politician after leading a bloody civil war for a decade that ended in 2006. The Maoists have emerged as Nepal's most potent political force after scoring a strong win in April elections for an assembly that abolished the monarchy and now is set to write a new

Luckily, even playing for the Oakland Raiders beats sitting out. interviews. One of the first guests Morrison spoke with was the animated Morrison was sent to Radio Row to perform pre-Super Bowl XLII Johnson. Morrison attempted to kindly initiate a conversation by asking, "What brings you out here?" By the time the 25-year-old linebacker got to the "out here" part, Johnson was already chiming in. "Yes, I will come to the Raiders," the four-time Pro Bowl wideout said. I can turn the black hole white." Whether Johnson is completely serious in his request is still up in the air.

Sunday, ESPN analyst Chris Mortensen cited an unidentified source, stating that Johnson "feels betrayed by head coach Marvin Lewis and is privately threatening to sit out the 2008 season if he isn't traded." "I'm not allowed to say [whether or not I'm happy]. I get the blame, the so-called best player. I'm the problem," Johnson commented on Rome's nationally syndicated radio show last week.

Since being drafted 36th overall in 2001, Johnson has spent his entire seven-year career with the Bengals, for whom he's hauled in 559 passes for 8,365 yards and 49 TDs. The ex-Oregon State standout has posted six 30, 2003. That week, he caught six passes for 117 yards and touchdown. For the disgruntled Johnson, though, getting his way won't be such an easy thing. The season before heading to Oakland, Moss had caught just 49 passes for 767 yards. Johnson nearly doubled those totals in 2007. So "come get me," Johnson tells the 78-year-old Davis. Kidding or not, Davis will likely take a shot at Ocho Cinco. We'll see how serious Johnson is then.

CONTEXT	 ' Iron Man '  lifts Marvel Entertainment 3Q profit Strong box office receipts for the film "Iron Man" lifted Marvel Entertainment Inc.'s third-quarter earnings 39 percent, according to a report Tuesday from the movie, licensing and comic-book But the story is likely to be different in 2009, when Marvel expects only "modest" performance. Peter Cuneo, Marvel's vice chairman, said the company hasn't seen a "material" impact from the slowing economy. For the three months ended Sept. 30, New York-based Marvel earned $50.6 million, or 64 cents per share, compared with $36.3 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 48 Marvel produced the movie. It was distributed by Paramount Pictures, which is owned by Sumner Redstone's media conglomerate Viacom Inc. Marvel's film production sales totaled $90.2 million in the third quarter -- including the box office take for "Iron Man," fees for serving as a producer for that movie and "The Incredible Hulk" "Iron Man" and "Hulk" were the first two movies Marvel produced, an arrangement that brings it more revenue than when it licenses movie rights to third-party producers. Marvel said DVD sales and rentals for "Iron Man" grossed $175 million as of Nov. 2, excluding five foreign regions where DVD rights were prearranged and the U.K., where reporting was slower. Other segments of Marvel's business softened. Licensing fees fell 29 percent to $58.1 million in the quarter as Spider-Man licensing and merchandise revenue weakened. Publishing sales Based on the stronger-than-expected film production revenue, Marvel raised its 2008 outlook to between $2.45 and $2.65 per share on revenue of $640 million to $670 million, from prior estimates of $1.55 to $1.75 per share on revenue of $450 million For 2009, Marvel forecast earnings per share of $1 to $1.35 on revenue of $415 million to $460 million. Analysts had projected earnings of $1.94 per share on revenue of $617.8 million. Marvel said that while its core licensing business continues to grow, the timing of its films and related revenue leads to variability in operating income. Marvel's next feature films, "Iron Man 2" and "Thor," are slated for release in summer 2010, with "The First Avenger: Captain America" and "The Avengers" to be released the following year. publishing company, which also raised its full-year forecast for

[ Source ] Jared Leto , actor/musician/emogoth, has been spending some time in Paris, France recently showing off his beauteous make-up work: R&B songstress Mya has just announced that she will be playing the role of murderous vamp Velma Kelly in the Broadway production of Chicago for a limited run this year . Here is one of the new promo images featuring Mya as Velma : Mya -- the Grammy-winning singer known for such hits as "Case of the Ex," "Ghetto Superstar" and "Lady Marmalade" -- will join the Tony-winning revival of Kander and Ebb's Chicago in May. According to a press notice, the multi-platinum recording artist will begin performances as merry murderess Velma Kelly May 12 at the Ambassador Theatre. Mya will stay with the long-running musical through July 13 ... Mya's association with the razzle-dazzle world of Chicago dates back to 2003 when she played Mona in the Rob Marshall-directed film version of "Chicago." In a statement Chicago producer Barry Weissler said, "It's not often that one encounters a performer with the level of accomplishment that Mya brings to the table. She is a true triple-threat -- a wonderful actor, an amazing singer, and an insanely talented dancer. She has an incredible sense of drive, intensity and showmanship that I'm confident will make her portrayal of Velma Kelly unlike anything we've ever seen." I love it! I think she is perfect for the role and I'm confident that she will be able to make this role her own. Mya will be appearing in Chicago for a few months leading into the Summer so I'm going to have to make sure to catch her on the Great White Way at some point during her run. [ Source ]

CONTEXT	 SC Gov. Mark Sanford Accused Of Being Behind Bauer "Gay Smear" Campaign  2009-09-04T00:00:00     SC GOP state Sen. Jake Knotts claims that Gov. Mark Sanford, angered over Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer's calls for his resignation, is the person behind Bauer's recent outing by gay blogger Mike Rogers. "As a former target of a false rumor started by the Sanford Camp I can tell you with absolute certainty this attack was orchestrated on behalf of Mark Sanford, either directly or indirectly, and financially subsidized by him or one of his many 'front-groups,'" Knotts wrote. The letter was first reported by "The Palmetto Scoop," a South Carolina political Web site. Knotts, an ally of Bauer and a fierce opponent of Sanford, said there is no truth to the gay rumors that have dogged Bauer for years. "I have known Andre since he was eight years old," Knotts told CNN. "Ain't a homosexual bone in his body. That boy is a good boy. It's a just an attempt to prevent Andre from become governor." Mike Rogers denies Knotts' allegation: “I don’t know anyone in Mark Sanford’s office,” Rogers told Free Times Sept. 3 while in a Washington, D.C. taxi cab. “I don’t know anybody on Mark Sanford’s political team. I don’t know anything about Mark Sanford except what’s been out there in the public and in the press.” Rogers says he has a 100 percent record with outing closeted politicians with anti-gay agendas, and he works his sources like any reporter would. “I know where these people work who are my sources,” he says about the ones regarding Bauer. “They don’t work in any political realm.” Labels: "celibacy" , Andre Bauer , Mark Sanford , Mike Rogers , outing , sanctity of marriage , South Carolina

CONTEXT	 A chat with environmentalist John Christy... We really don't communicate. We serve on a committee for NASA together, but it only deals with specific satellite issues. At the Ways and Means hearing, he was sitting two people down from me, but he did not want to engage any of the evidence I presented. And that seems to be the preferred tactic of many in the alarmist camp. Rather than bring up these issues, they simply ignore them. (Contacted by Fortune, Hansen acknowledges that his 1988 projections were based on a model that "slightly" overstated the warming created by a doubling in CO2 levels. His new model posits a rise of 3 degrees Celsius in global temperatures by 2100, vs. 4.2 degrees in the old one. Says Hansen, "The projections that the public has been hearing about are based on a climate sensitivity that is consistent with the global warming rate of the past few decades." Christy's response: "Hansen at least admits his 1988 forecasts were wrong, but doesn't say they were way wrong, not 'slightly,' as he states." Christy also claims that even Hansen's revised models grossly overestimated the amount of warming that has actually occurred.) I know you think there's been something of a hysteria in the media about melting glaciers. Could you explain?

CONTEXT	 Netanyahu impresses the Egyptians...  2009-12-29T12:03:00   GayandRight  They too believe he really wants peace with the Palestinians... Israel's prime minister on Tuesday presented Egypt with ideas for restarting Mideast peace talks, impressing his hosts with proposals that go further than past Israeli positions, Egypt's top diplomat said. The sides also discussed the latest developments in efforts to broker a prisoner swap between Israel and the Hamas militant group. A top Hamas official in Damascus told The Associated Press that the group had rejected the latest proposal from Israel. He said Israel was refusing to release key prisoners and insisting on mass deportations of freed militants. Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit refused to divulge specifics on Tuesday's discussions, but said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears serious about trying to resume negotiations with the Palestinians. "I can't talk about details, but the prime minister was discussing positions that surpass in our estimate what we've heard from them in a long time," Aboul Gheit told reporters. "I can't say that he has come with changed positions, but he is moving forward."

And OMG but what a wonderful first thing to see on my computer at 6:15AM - fake sweating Jake with gorgeous biceps running down the streets of Pittsburgh! Okay, I'll admit, I went to the school website to look at the new lunch menu first but the 2nd thing I saw on my computer this morning was above described Jake! *THUD* Big thank yous to IHJ indeed! I'm laughing at the 90's of it all...the old headphones attached to what I'm assuming is a Walkman (no iPods or MP3s back then)! And the Everlast brand was more popular then too. I love the spray bottles spraying Jake down and what a great idea WDW...a possible career move? Becoming a Jake Gyllenhaal Sweat Sprayer?!  2009-10-01T18:21:00  Hello! Back home having survived my first day - time to relax.... I'm so happy Jake celebrated my first day by getting all sweaty :D Hi Winterbird! I fear we've had similar thoughts about that fake sweat. So sexy.  2009-10-02T03:10:00   Anonymous  Hooray!!! I just happened to be watching PBS tonight, and they had a preview of Sesame Street's new season - among the celebrities, there was Jake! He looked very cute - :) Hope your first day OTJ went well, OMG, good luck! :*  2009-10-02T03:13:00  ^^Oops, I meant to write "WDW" - it's been a long day and I'm getting my letters mixed up. Thanks Carol! I hope you have a good Friday today. I like these two day weeks :D Have a good day everyone and keep your eyes peeled for more Wet Jake!  2009-10-02T13:11:00  It was exciting, WDW - it was part of the PBS National Parks program -so it was the Sesame Street characters, both human and Muppet, singing about Nature, and Jake was singing with a Muppet too - but it was just a quick clip - I'll have to watch again tonight to describe it more fully. It was just quick and unexpected. A very nice preview for PBS' new season, they usually have great ones!  2009-10-02T13:33:00   BBMISwear  Why am I not surprised that the topic Jake will be a part of on Sesame Street has to do with Nature and National Parks?! Yay Jake! I now have PBS running continuously on my television waiting for the breaks between shows to hopefully see the promo with Jake in it. Oh the memories it is bringing back of when my son watched A LOT of PBS 10 years ago! Hopefully this little clip will find it's way to the internet soon...no matter if it's only a few seconds long or not...us Jake fans take these things seriously!  2009-10-02T14:42:00  ^^It was very sweet - reminded me about teaching children the love of nature - the magic of a child's viewpoint. Elmo was camping, etc. Very cute! It's so nice that Jake and Reese are involved in children's issues, and also the environment. :) Thanks so much for the info, Anon! How I'd love to see Jake singing with a Muppet!! Hey BBMISwear :-) I'm laughing at the idea of you pinned to PBS! They must show it again... I really hope it makes its way on to the net as I really wanna see it! My voice went up a notch then... Jake and Elmo in the same clip? Gets better and better! Thanks Anon :)  2009-10-02T17:39:00  Awww, I hope we get to see it on You Tube! Think of how much Ramona will enjoy seeing her uncle Jake and her mom on TV with Elmo and the gang. In fact, Ramona will be celebrating b'day number three any minute! Cannot believe time has passed so quickly.

CONTEXT	 Nepali gov't asks NCTA to call off protest programs The government Friday asked the Nepal Cable Television Association (NCTA) to call off its protest programs after agreeing to address NCTA's demands. NCTA had announced a series of protest programs to press the government to fulfill its 18-point demands, a leading website, eKantiput.com reported. After a meeting of NCTA and the government officials at the Ministry of Informational and Communication, the government informed that it would assess NCTA's demands. However, NCTA has insisted that they would stop their protests only if the government promises to bring in a long-term program to address the issues of NCTA. NCTA suspended the state-owned Nepal television and NTV 2 channels from their cables as part of the first phase of their protest programs. NCTA has warned that all international news channels will also be blocked if the government fails to meet their demands. The major demands of NCTA include providing industry status to cable operators, a uniform permit letter, the right to broadcast local programs, among others.

CONTEXT	  Maggie Funkhouser <ACRMaggie...@gmail.com>   2008-01-22T10:50:00  The Pet Safety and Protection Act was passed by both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate, as an amendment to the Farm Bill. Thanks to Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) and Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA), for adding this provision to the bill, this act will strengthen federal from being sold to research clinics.  This bill is the first of its protections for companion animals and prevent stolen companion animals kind!  We must see it through! The last step to ensure the success of this bill is to pressure the Agriculture Committee to pass it.  House and Senate members of the Agriculture Committee will be meeting soon to iron out the differences between their respective versions of the Farm Bill.  However, some members on the committee may seek to eliminate or weaken the PSPA.  It is essential that all members be encouraged to support the House version in the FARM bill, for the Senate version includes a 5-year phase-in period, as well as potentially problematic ambiguous language. Therefore, we must act now in order to get the PSPA over the finish line!  ACR is encouraging our members to contact your representatives and tell them you support the PSPA.  Tell them it will keep companion http://capwiz.com/compassionindex/directory/committees.tt?commid=hagri (House) http://capwiz.com/compassionindex/directory/committees.tt?commid=sagri (Senate) to their versions of the FARM Bill. *       You appreciate that both chambers of Congress have attached the PSPA *       You respectfully request that he or she support the House version of the PSPA. **When contacting legislators, please mention:

CONTEXT	 The short of it for tonight is that anyone who treats the music with respect and shows some spark will find themselves with a few hundred thousand extra votes. One thing that that means is that Phil just saved his ass for one more week, and I wasted a few minutes earlier today gathering material for his obituary...or un-bituary...whatever you write for the zombie version of whoever someone was before the reapening or wrought-ening or smelt-ening or whichever olden-dayes term for commodity production sounds most ominous on a movie poster. Phil is, apparently, a "country boy" from the "countryside" which is true in that I suppose the zone around Chernobyl is a kind of countryside...and Phil certainly does bear the identifying markers of it...He commences a stately pallbearer's stroll through the crowd and dozens drop dead at his touch. But he does well and is identified by the judges as someone who belongs in country...so he's in for one more. Speaking of the damned...Jordin is dressed and painted up just like a groupie for the 1983-84 iteration of that very group. What is it about "Broken Wing" that makes everyone stupid? Martina McBride's advice?: "When you sing "Broken Wing" you really need to just sing it." Randy's response: "You know when that song was originally done, it was sung." as opposed to being kazooe'd??? Glockenspieled???? Underarm-farted???? Never mind the fact that...can you even fathom how much a broken wing would hurt an angel? Can you imagine the carnage? I stub my toe and I destroy whatever tchotchke is unfortunate enough to stray into my field of blasphemous screams...and I'm weak even for a human. Jordin has so perfected the art of blasting air through the massive hydraulic bellows that are her lungs at high velocity and in a focused beam that I fully expect the next Bond villain to launch her into low orbit and aim her at various bridges and nuclear facilities...if they pass their ISO 9000 accreditation. Based on his "wardrobe" Sanjaya's "country" is apparently that fictional version of little Puerto Rico whose only other inhabitant is one Juan Epstein. Martina wants him to be "bigger and stronger" and Moby's father wanted him to play prop for New Zealand Rugby. Too bad. He seems fond of planting his feet and obsessively wiggling his hips like some horrible animatronic from a Missouri State Highway Patrol traveling diorama on the connection between marijuana consumption and adult-onset autism...I closed my eyes and he sounded exactly like a cassette tape recording that a sad, lonely child might have made (okay did make....shut up!) in 1979 to play for his family...and while that sad, lonely child's rendition of "Heart of Glass" KICKED ASS, just like tonight, it caused an unfortunate stir among various embarrassed family members...and the whole family starts fighting about whether to have him sent to that summer camp for special kids and dad (Simon) lets out the "R[etarded]" word and little sister (Ryan) throws a fucking fit and child services are called and Aunt Paula informs us that this is why she needs to go to be alone in the bathroom with her bottles sometimes, and big brother (Randy) just stares at the ground and wishes he was at football practice...what a disaster. That child, by the way? Grew up to be Zach Braff...so...deal with it.

CONTEXT	 The outrageous charges against the six are a brazen attack against the anti-war movement meant to discourage protest. At an impromptu press conference after the arrests, Cardinal Francis George suggested that the protesters were guilty of committing a violent act. Not that the Pope is really opposed to violence; he just wants it approved by the U.N. Security Council , where countries are free to sell their souls to the devil United States (or perhaps even NATO, where the U.S. carries almost total sway, would suffice for "his holiness"): Oh no, I'm sure the people of Iraq don't see the death of a million of their compatriots as an "unwanted imposition," and I'm sure no one thinks the wholesale bombing of Yugoslavia in response to alleged (and later proven virtually non-existent) ethnic cleansing in Kosovo was a "limitation of sovereignty." The Pope did say that "What is needed is a deeper search for ways of pre-empting and managing conflicts by exploring every possible diplomatic avenue, and giving attention and encouragement to even the faintest sign of dialogue or desire for reconciliation." As I recall, George Bush said pretty much the same thing before invading and destroying Iraq. He explored "every possible diplomatic avenue" to avoid the "need" to attack Iraq. The poor Pope. I'm sure he longs for the days when he had his own army.  2008-04-18T16:33:00   DavidByron  I'm not sure what is wrong with the statement. Yes Bush said a bunch of stuff like that too, but Bush was lying and was forced to lie. It doesn't mean the Pope is lying. "if carried out lawfully" I don't understand your examples. Neither Iraq not Kosovo were sanctioned by the UN. Even if they had been the events that led to a million dead are against a lot of laws (essentially almost any bombing is illegal). The UN carries enough weight that it is a good sized bump in the road to imperial war, yes even corrupted as it is. Both Clinton and Bush felt the need to try to get some sort of UN resolution. Both failed. Dismissing the institution will only help warmongers.  2008-04-18T19:40:00   Eli Stephens  David, it's true that Bush didn't get a final resolution, but he still claimed he was attacking Iraq under the authorization of previous resolutions. And if he had managed to bully a few more countries and get the second resolution passed, would that have made you accept the war? Not me. And Kosovo was carried out under a NATO mandate, which certainly qualifies as "other international instruments" according to the Pope's language.

CONTEXT	 Once again, Katie Holmes was looking stunning on the red carpet last night ... it appears that marriage seems to be agreeing with her. Perhaps I've been too hasty with all the picking on her and her marriage to Tom Cruise ? Pshaw ... nah ... I think it's all still a wildly elaborate sham but that doesn't mean that I can't think the girl looks faboo from time to time. She clearly outshined her co-stars Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah , that's for sure. I must admit that the movie looks cute from the trailers that are playing on TV right now but I don't know that it's for me. Every time I see Diane Keaton in a movie I want it to be just like The First Wives Club ... but Katie is no Goldie Hawn and Queen L is no Bette Midler . If it's worth seeing, lemme know ... otherwise I think I'll take a pass. Oh and I have to say that creepy actor William Mapother really creeps me out every time he pops up somewhere ... and not because his creepy cousin is Tom Cruise (ahtho, that is a bit creepy) but because of his creepy role as Ethan Rom on Lost . Yikes. [ Source ] Rumor has it that Pamela Anderson has gotten herself in a "family way" and will be giving birth to her 3rd child, presumably fathered by her latest husband Rick Solomon ... who she is still planning to divorce despite a last minute attempt at a reconciliation late last month. BUT ... a curious post on Pammy 's official blog might be a hint that the reports of her pregnancy are wrong: TMZ has learned the divorce between Pam Anderson and Rick Salomon is back on and Pam is pregnant! You'll recall Anderson filed for divorce last month, but called it off just days later. But sources tell TMZ she is now moving forward with the divorce, even though we know she's pregnant with his baby. Salomon has told friends he believes she is "acting crazy" because of the pregnancy and hopes she will settle back into the marriage. Interestingly, in her divorce petition, Anderson asked for spousal support but not child support. Hmm ... but shortly after this news began to spread, Pamela posted a blogpost that stated simply, No. Who knows what she is saying No to ... her pregnancy, any chance of calling off the divorce again, whathaveyou. At this point, we have no idea what she means unless she clarifies ... or begins to show a baby bump. Man, is 2008 turning into the year of the Celebrity Baby already or what?

CONTEXT	 2008-02-28T11:25:00   ????  Here is Heidi Klum and her hotty hubby Seal at the 16th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards viewing party. The party was hosted by Jennifer Love Hewitt and was held at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood on Sunday. Heidi is best known for her superstar status and the major beauty that goes along with it, and she just never seems to have a hair out of place, does she? So Heidi had some folks wondering at the Night Before the Oscars party as to why she was carrying around a paper cup all night. Some people thought she was eating take-out soup or something, but it did catch some attention. Heidi later explained it was a gift from Wolfgang Puck, he had given her some of his special salad dressing and she and Seal just couldn’t get enough of it. I find it strange that Wolfgang couldn’t be bothered to use oh I don’t know, Tupperware, for a gift that comes in liquid form. And even stranger that Heidi didn’t have *anyone* around to take it off her hands for the night. Toting takeout at the Night Before the Oscars party just seems a little um…strange. No?  Source: E!

CONTEXT	 RICHMOND, Virginia 2007-05-03 17:11:27 UTC Thousands of people are expected to jam Richmond's Capitol Square on Thursday for a glimpse of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, when the British royals arrive to mark the 400th The queen and Prince Philip left England on a chartered British Airways plane, and were expected to land at the Richmond Airport at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT). The queen also plans to attend the Kentucky Derby and meet President George W. Bush. In Richmond, the queen was to address Virginia's General Assembly and meet 100-year-old civil rights lawyer Oliver W. Hill Sr., whose litigation contributed to the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court Terry O'Neill, owner of the Beatles-influenced Penny Lane Pub in Richmond, was just a small boy from Liverpool the last time he got within a few feet (meters) of Queen Elizabeth II. Thanks to the governor, a former Richmond mayor and occasional Penny Lane patron, the O'Neills have front-row access for the queen's 200-yard (183-meter) "walkabout" from the Executive carriage through Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia's capital until On Thursday evening, the queen was expected to take a horse-drawn then-Gov. Thomas Jefferson and the legislature fled to Richmond to elude British capture in the Revolutionary War. Richmond officials have spent days frantically preparing for their first royal visit. For much of Richmond's downtown work force, the queen's visit means a day off, and many will spend it on the Capitol's sloping South Lawn before her mid-afternoon arrival, listening to musical

CONTEXT	Joyim for Goyim  2008-02-24T12:44:42  Miliband, Mild Mel and the Joys of Judeocracy Luke O'Farrell "We propose that it be made an offence to download material from the internet that could incite racial or religious hatred." When it was claimed that the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) made that sinister, totalitarian proposal in September 2006, you could understand what George W. Bush meant when he said: "They hate us for our freedoms." Staunch in defense of freedom, Britain's conservative commentariat rushed to condemn the MCB. "Free speech is the bedrock of a free society!" they thundered. "Any group that seeks to undermine it has no place in a democracy. If Muslims don't like Britain's proud, centuries-old tradition of free speech, they know what they can do: get out!" Shamefully, however, many defenders of Western freedom against Islamist tyranny seem to have forgotten what the MCB said in 2006. If you're one of them, here's an extract from The Times to refresh your memory: The All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism was set up last year. None of the 14 members of the panel is Jewish, but evidence was taken from across the Jewish community. The report proposes that it be made an offence to download material from the internet that could incite racial or religious hatred.  Drawing on the view of the Macpherson report that a racist act is defined by its victim, not by whether a perpetrator considers himself racist, anti-Semitism is defined in the report as "any remark, insult or act, the purpose or effect of which is to violate a Jewish person's dignity or create an for him". (Loc. cit., 7th September 2006) intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment Oh dear, so it wasn't the MCB who wanted to turn us into a police-state after all: it was the philosemitic politicians who conducted the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism. Whoever would have guessed it? Anyone who knows about Jews and free speech, that's who.  If Jews have power and influence, they start working to take away free speech. It's no use arguing that some Jews support free speech and some white goyim oppose it: the average effect of the two groups is perfectly clear. It was whites who created free speech in the West and it is Jews who are taking it away. Was there any popular support for Britain's race laws, introduced in the 1960s and steadily harshened ever since? No, there wasn't, but what does the will of the people matter in a democracy? The Board of Jewish Deputies wanted the race laws and got them. The Jewish Anti-Defamation League would like identical laws in the United States; so far, thanks to the evil white males who created the First Amendment, it hasn't gotten them.  Canadians haven't been so lucky, as the neo-con Mark Steyn has entirely blameless: like, but let's give him his due: he's admitted that Jews aren't Submission from the Board of Deputies of British Jews The Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomes the opportunity to make this submission to the Select Committee on Religious Offences. The Board is the representative body and voice of the British Jewish community. It was founded in 1760. The Jewish community is covered by the provisions of the Race Relations Acts. The Board is generally satisfied with the format of the current legislation following the amendments to Part 3 of the Public Order Act in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. The Malicious Communications Act 1998 and its subsequent amendment offer further protection. Together these have removed the legal and linguistic barriers which previously had hampered prosecutions. The UK is now faced with a growth in inter-religious friction, sparked in large measure by conflict in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. This has led to the dissemination of propaganda deliberately attacking Jews qua Jews by Muslims. The Sikh and Hindu communities have similarly been targeted. We are in touch with representative bodies within these communities and can provide examples of such incitement. The Board of Deputies welcomes the proposal to introduce new laws to combat incitement to religious hatred, but notes that this must be matched by the political will to prosecute offenders. Otherwise any new powers risk becoming as ineffective as the existing laws against incitement to racial hatred. "It's not enough, already! Ve vont more laws! No free speech for ze vicked goyim!" And Mark Steyn isn't tackling another vital question: that of how Muslims got into the West in such large numbers to join the Jew-initiated, Jew-continued assault on free speech. Was there any popular support for mass immigration by Muslims in Britain, for example? No, there wasn't: there was massive popular opposition. But what does the will of the people matter in a democracy? Britain is run for the benefit of those who fund its political parties: men like excuse for conspiring to make secret payments to New Labour was that "Lord" Levy, his pals from Jewish Care, and David Abrahams, whose he wanted to avoid the appearance of "a Jewish conspiracy". That's what democracy means in Britain: Jews pay, pols obey. Want thought crime laws? You got 'em! Want mass immigration? You got it! Want war  in Iraq? You got that too! Stone is president of the Jewish Council for Racial Equality Stone wants to keep "racism" high on the agenda because he wants to keep bashing whites. How racist is Britain? Very racist - against whites. When you trace the sources of the "Hammer Honky!" religion, you find that Jews are there every time, controlling, "advising", passing laws to suppress white dissent. Free speech is indeed the bedrock of a free society, which is why free societies and Jews don't mix. Those are the joys of Judeocracy and they'll keep on coming until we take our societies back.

CONTEXT	 AMBERGIS CAYE, Belize 2008-05-31 20:45:53 UTC A weak tropical storm formed Saturday off the Yucatan Peninsula and quickly made landfall at the Belize-Mexico border, dumping rain and kicking up surf. The storm hit land near the Mexican port city of Chetumal and Belize's Corozal city, dumping rain as far south as Belize City and kicking up strong surf on the popular tourist island of Ambergis Caye. Tropical storm warnings were issued for Belize and Mexico's Caribbean coastline. In northern Belize, the National Emergency Management Organization expected about 4 inches (102 millimeters) of rain and warned of possible flooding around the Azul Hondo River. At 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) the storm's center was located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Belize City.

CONTEXT	 It's worth noting that the audience was very unsatisfied with this movie. "Overactor!" and "I want my money back" were shouted at the screen. Several people walked out during the third or fourth ending. Murmurs of "Why can't the bad guys just be bad?" and "You know what I would have done..." filled the halls as we all poured out of the theater melancholy and defeated. Me? I could have done without all the mushy stuff. I like my bad guys bad and their motives unexplained. I also like my superheroes with buyable alter egos. That's why Michael Keaton was so great as Batman. That guy was weird and dead inside with a wry smile and cynical flair. Tobey Maguire? Meh. His stunt double? My hero! Bottom Line: The battle sequences and the Sandman effects are worth the price of admission but prepare yourself for "dramatic" scenes that will bore you senseless. Bruce Campbell is a god among insects. Or arachnids. His scene brought the house down.  ????-??-??T19:55:00   Defender of the Future  This review is amazing. I love Bruce Campbell.

CONTEXT	 2009-08-27T02:39:00   Wet Dark and Wild  Today, the WDW and BBMISwear Moonlight Mile Road Trip continued through Gloucester and Marblehead. with a little bit of Salem's Lot thrown in for good measure and lunch. I am delighted to announce that following yesterday's discovery of the Moonlight Mile post office, BBMISwear did indeed throw herself head first through the hatch. The post office mistress did the only thing she could have done in such a situation - stand well back and take pictures. We thank you, Deb! As recompense we did spend $2 on stamps...)  From Gloucester we took the scenic route to Marblehead (via other places which were in completely the wrong direction). Marblehead was the sight for Dustin's Real Estate office and for the diner across the street. We loved this town - it was quiet, with amazing architecture and with a very friendly bunch of locals. The Real Estate Office is now a toy shop but the girl behind the counter, despite being only 20, remembered the filming well and talked about seeing Dustin in the office. She also gave us the news that the floor we stood on was Brad Silberling's floor. Designed to last three days, it was still under our feet but was soon to be removed. In a WDW exclusive, BBMISwear's feet can be seen here expertly modelling Jake's Floor. We have had the most marvellous reception from the people of the Moonlight Mile towns - as a result I expect rentings of the movie to soar in these towns! Thank you so much for your welcome. Pictures from IHJ and WDW, with many thanks to the people of Gloucester and Marblehead (with no thanks to the people who design the signage).  2009-08-27T09:11:00   Anonymous  This was just wonderful, BBMISwear and WDW. Marblehead and Salem, and Gloucester of course! are so cozy. Glad you are enjoying yourselves on such a fun trip. I'm going to have to watch Moonlight Mile again. Thanks guys! :*  2009-08-27T18:11:00   paulh  When I saw "Moonlight mile," I never had any clue that the locale was Gloucester and Marshfield. For all I could tell, the story could have taken place anywhere on the Eastern seaboard from New Jersey to Maine. I guess I have some motivation for exploring Marshfield and Gloucester, now. :-) BBMISwear did a great job, Olympia! The post mistress had vague knowledge of the film but that was it, it'sreally out of the way. But she was so in to it. Hi Paul! You must go and explore :) But it was filmed in Gloucester and Marblehead. Both lovely towns and full of very friendly people. That is great, FF! I enjoyed reading that.

Via press release: NO on Prop 8 campaign, Equality for All, is pleased to announce today that Ellen DeGeneres has made a media buy to urge Californians to vote NO on Proposition 8. The effort was partially revealed Tuesday when Ellen released a special video to confront false and misleading scare tactics used by those supporting the proposition. DeGeneres is purchasing television time for her ad to underscore the importance of this fight and broaden the reach of the spot. Ellen's message says, "Hi, I'm Ellen DeGeneres. I got to do something this year I never thought I'd ever be able to do: I got married. It was the happiest day of my life. There are people out there raising millions of dollars to try and take that right away from me. You've seen their ads on TV. They're twisting the truth, and they're trying to scare you. I believe in fairness. I believe in compassion. I believe in equality for all people. Proposition 8 does not. Please, please, vote no on Prop. 8." "In her desire to speak directly to the people of California, Ellen has stepped up as only Ellen can," said Patrick Guerriero, Campaign Director. "Her voice has a tremendous ability to elevate this conversation above the scare tactics and help people understand what's at stake for the people they know and care about. Her generous contribution to the campaign comes just at the right moment - and is done in a way that ensures her conversation with voters continues to Election Day. And it delivers our message that Proposition 8 is unfair and just plain wrong." You can view the clip in a post I made on Tuesday and on the No On 8 donation page .

CONTEXT	 I think this is the best thing I've read about the 2008 Republican race yet: I'm not saying McCain is a &quot;winner&quot; in the Hail-to-the-Chief sense, I'm just saying right now he's most likely to wind up with the nomination. This is beginning to feel like a thriller with tons of wild plot twists but a disappointing finale. Imagine 1996 with exciting car chases round hairpin bends but you still wind up with Bob Dole. Mark Steyn does an excellent job of summing up where we are at right now. McCain is by no means coronated yet, but this (South Carolina) is a big boost to his momentum. Disappointingly, Fred Thompson finished third behind Huckabee. It is going to take one hell of a Super Tuesday to keep him in it. I'll admit that I have been very leaning Thompson since he entered the race, but I wanted to see a Thompson campaign that grabbed voters by the shoulders and said, &quot;you've got no reason not to vote for him.&quot; Without it, I never could see him winning a general election. Unfortunately, while he's shown a little fire, his campaign has never been up to par. Unless they have some secret strategy that they've been holding back, I'm not sure he'll even be a candidate by the time Wisconsin's primary rolls around.

CONTEXT	 No country should let in Al-Manure... AUSTRALIA should investigate jamming an anti-Semitic, pro-terrorism television station being broadcast into Australia from Indonesia, a Jewish advocacy group says. Anti-Defamation Commission chairman John Searle said yesterday he was disappointed that Australia's Arabic community was supporting the station, al-Manar. The Australian Communication and Media Authority has twice stopped the channel from being broadcast in Australia, in 2004 and in January this year, because of its support for terrorism. Now it is being transmitted by an Indonesian satellite company part-owned by the Indonesian Government, which has declined American requests to halt the broadcasts. Al-Manar is operated by Hezbollah, a militant Lebanese Muslim party banned in the United States as a terrorist organisation. In Australia only its armed wing is proscribed.

CONTEXT	Photo credit: Splash News  Talk inside the company is that either it's redone, or they need to drop it - and her. When this recording session began, she'd just dumped Federline the Insect. It was not a good time in her life. To recharge her career, she reconnected with her long-ago first-time manager, the one who originally brought her to the heights, Larry Rudolph. But constant headlined misbehavior is stoking the problem. Jive fears she's alienating her fan base. Their fan base. Jive caters to a young music-buyer, and the continued atmosphere - drinking, bingeing, partying, whatevering, photos with no panties for a mother of two infants - is hitting sour notes. Besides, Jive is not in sync with the five tracks Brit delivered. Conversation in their offices is: If we bear the expense of a redo, is it possible that, down the road, because of the way she's going, we could end up with a really bad product? Or one that won't sell? The recording has stopped midway. Nothing more's been done because the company doesn't yet know what it wants to do. But that recent front page ain't helping. Meanwhile, Life & Style magazine is reporting that the Sanctuary spa that Britney retreated to after her crazy New Year's Eve night is just the first stop on her way to a real rehab center : After falling asleep (or, according to some reports, possibly passing out) at a New Year's Eve bash in Las Vegas, Britney Spears reportedly checked in to an Arizona spa for some good ol' fashioned R&R on New Year's Day. But some are wondering if a third "R" might be in the pop star's future -- could Brit be headed to rehab? According to Life & Style Weekly, who reported Brit checked into an Arizona spa called Sanctuary, the singer's parents are urging their daughter to enter therapy. "It's just been heartbreaking for her parents to watch Britney on this downward spiral," a Spears "insider" reportedly told the magazine. "It's so sad." Jive Records is refuting these reports, saying : "No rehab, and Cindy Adams' piece is inaccurate. No clue where she go her 'information.' Britney is in the middle of recording. We will have an album in 2007." Hmm ... yep, sounds like a very Britney way to kick off the new year. I guess we'll have to wait and see what comes of any of this ... I'd love to see a new album this year but I'd rather wait for quality if it would take a little longer. [ Source ] In much happier, drama-less news, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt spent a quiet weekend down in Panama taking in the sights, pressing flesh with the locals and pretty much just hanging out ... here are a few pictures of Brangelina taking in the sights at a local art gallery and then meeting some fans on the street: Why must the Gods be so cruel to us?

CONTEXT	felt "great" after a health scare that forced him to check into a US Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani said Sunday he hospital last week.  While he declined to tell ABC television what his doctor's diagnosis was, Giuliani said tests had shown no return of the prostate cancer that forced him out to drop out of the race for New York senator in 2000. The episode came just two weeks before the launch of the state- by-state contests to choose nominees for the 2008 presidential election, and it put a focus on Giuliani's position as national great and you know actually reassured by the fact that I had so "I'm back on the trail, ready to go, hail and hearty, feeling many different tests and they all came back 100 percent," the former New York mayor said. Giuliani, whose lead in national polls has been slipping, promised a full account of last week's health scare after Tuesday's Christmas holiday, but told ABC's "This Week" that he felt "terrific." He said he had suffered a bad headache that got steadily worse on Wednesday, leading him to order his plane bound for New York to turn around several minutes after taking off from St Louis, He said it worsened in the evening, when he was speaking to a rally with a local lawmaker in St Louis, after which he planned to fly back to his home in New York. "My staff was very concerned so we turned around. I actually made that decision. (We) were only six or seven minutes out. It actually made no sense to get on the plane," he said. But he said a test that looks for prostate cancer had come back "negligible," and that his doctor in New York had advised him to take aspirin but no prescription medicine. "After Christmas he can address this himself," Giuliani said. "He's going to put out everything that's appropriate to show that I'm in good health." With his national lead slipping, and his rivals leading in several of the first states to vote on nominees, Giuliani said he had returned to full-scale campaigning. The prostate cancer diagnosis in 2000 forced Giuliani to drop out of the race for New York senator, a move which cleared the way for an easy victory by Hillary Clinton, who is now the Missouri.

CONTEXT	 ...and, somehow, the troop pullouts from Iraq are always sometime in the future. Although that didn't start a local newscaster from starting a sentence, "While troop levels in Iraq are decreasing..." No, they are not. They may , sometime in the future. Meanwhile, George Bush says an increase in troops in Afghanistan (U.S. and members of the coalition of the billing) is a "quiet surge." I'm not sure how much of that "quiet" the Afghan people can stand.  2008-09-09T18:36:00   Eli Stephens  Congress voted in 2001 to authorize the administration to "go after the terrorists." That's all the authorization they need. Well, that, plus a compliant Congress who wouldn't dream of challenging them on that front. Remember, it was Obama who was the first to start harping on the need to start bombing Pakistan, not Bush or McCain.  2008-09-09T19:59:00   Erroll  Per your link involving the massacre of 90 Afghan civilians, a story in today's AP says that the U.S. commander of the NATO-led force says there is 'imagery evidence' "that suggests that the evidence that the U.S. military used in ... its investigation may not have been complete." It remains to be seen how much culpability the Pentagon will assign itself as more evidence is uncovered and as more dead bodies appear on these grainy videos. As the AP story recounts: "The videos do not provide proof that 60 children died in the operation, but the images do appear to contradict a U.S. military investigation that found only seven civilians were killed in Azizabad, along with up to 35 militants."  2008-09-09T20:05:00  Dead men tell no tales, and who on earth is going to be able to say that someone other than a child or a woman was a "militant" or just an "innocent civilian" or maybe even an outspoken supporter of U.S. occupation?  2008-09-09T20:16:00   dancewater  Kay Hagen, running for US Senate in NC against Dole, told me that she will "draw down" forces in Iraq and send them to Afghanistan to get the terrorists. When I pointed out to her that our policies are now creating more terrorists, she turned away. So, she has the same position as Obama and as our Blue Dog Democrat here in western NC. ``One wonders if the Pentagon will ever reduce the number of those 35 militants down to zero. In all probability, that possibility appears highly unlikely.'' Of course not: do you expect them to admit that they attacked that village and killed 90 innocent people without having the foggiest idea what was actually there, having made no investigation whatever of what they were told? No one likes to look stupid in public, esp. when that stupidity lead one to commit a serious war crime.

CONTEXT	 Almost a year on from snatching Congress from the Republicans, US Democrats say they are doing a tremendous job -- but voters don't seem to be listening. But they have disappointed supporters who hoped they would halt the war, recently sparked a nasty foreign policy row with Turkey, and have found that Bush, though wounded, remains a ferocious adversary. Democrats are also still short of the two-thirds House and Senate majorities needed to override presidential vetoes, and have struggled in the area where their supporters had the highest Repeated failures to force Bush to accept troop withdrawal timetables, changes to US strategy, and longer rest periods for American troops, appear to be overshadowing the rest of the Democratic agenda. Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, has his own woes: his popularity ratings in his state of Nevada have tumbled to just 32 percent. Reports last week said party leaders were poised to launch a publicity blitz in November to tout their achievements, worried the high octane 2008 presidential race will drown them out. "This Congress, more than any other Congress I have seen, is focused on the next election," said Professor Steven Smith of Washington University, St Louis. "For the Democrats the question is, how do they muddle through this, so they can realize those electoral gains, including the White House?" September 11 commission into law, raising the minimum wage, signature achievements -- enshrining recommendations of the passing ethics and lobbying reform and expanded student loans. House Democratic majority leader Steny Hoyer said his party could show an "extraordinarily successful" report card. "Congress needs to keep their promise, to stop wasting time, and get essential work done on behalf of the American people," Bush said Friday. passage of more than 100 bills signed into law -- pointing out Republicans Friday gleefully punctured Democratic pride over the that 46 of them named post offices, courthouses and roads. "This Democratic Majority has increasingly put politics before accomplishment," blasted House Republican minority leader John Boehner. Republicans have 21 seats up for election in 2008, and they have In the Senate, Democrats have one priceless, advantage -- only 12, and only one, in Louisiana, is endangered.

CONTEXT	 When I read about left wing extremists in the news, I don't identify with them nor do I lump all liberals and democrats in with them. When we protested the war in DC, we weren't wishing that Bush was dead nor did anyone want to kill him. Of course we would like to see him tried for war crimes and thrown in jail. But when the DHS released a warning about right wing extremists and the danger they pose, Michelle Malkin and Newsbusters went up in arms saying that the DHS was targeting all conservatives. Duh. If I were a conservative, I'd give her a piece of my mind. After all, in all fairness not all conservatives are anti-government, pro-gun bigots who'd like to see Obama dead. I'm sure that many of you know wingnuts who would like to see bad things happen to the president but you don't automatically lump them together with everyone who voted for McCain. More on this ~

CONTEXT	message of rebirth.US President George W. Bush will, for the visit rich in superlatives and precedents, and resonating with a first time in seven years in office, greet the pope at the airport when he arrives on Tuesday afternoon, the White House said.  "The president and Mrs Bush will take the unprecedented step of driving (in motorcade) to Andrews Air Force base in order to greet the pope," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. The official welcoming ceremony for Benedict will take place the following day -- the pope's 81st birthday -- at the White House, where he will be given a 21-gun salute in front of a crowd of between 9,000 and 12,000. Posters announcing the papal visit -- the first since Benedict was elected pope in 2005 and the first since his predecessor John Paul II stopped in St Louis in 1999 -- draped city buses. Banners on street posts waved in the spring breeze along the broad boulevards that Benedict will travel down in the Popemobile and official motorcades.

On Monday, secret service agents staged a dress rehearsal for the mass -- with one agent in white vestments playing the pope, said Susan Gibbs, spokeswoman for the archdiocese of Washington.

"I think the centerpiece (of his UN speech) will be the pursuit of peace," said Chester Gillis of Georgetown University's theology department. At New York's St Patrick's Cathedral, Benedict will address the issue of pedophile priests and the bishops accused by victim support groups of covering up for them, but he is not expected to meet with victims of the abuse scandal that has left the US church financially strapped and morally battered. "Although the survivors may want a meeting, this is a visit to all Americans," said Monsignor Batholomew Smith, who assisted one of the cardinal electors at the conclave in April 2005 at which Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected pope following the death of This is a pope with huge intellectual horsepower, who pays great "Events may not be huge in scale but they are broad in nature. attention to people, even if he is less of a media star than John Paul II," Smith said. "Benedict has a high understanding of the situation here, and having come up through the curia, he knows what his aides are trying to filter out" when they brief him on the US church and Benedict's visit will end Sunday after mass for some 60,000 in New York's Yankee stadium and a first-ever visit by a pontiff to Ground Zero, site of the main September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

CONTEXT	 The Bachelorette 5: Preview of Episode 6- Who will stay and who will go? The pressure intensifies as Jillian Harris decides which five men will have the chance to take her home to meet their families. But before the crucial hometown dates, she must first take the remaining eight bachelors to a Canadian cross-county train ride, tonight at 8pm on ABC. When we last saw The Bachelorette , Jillian brought her suitors to her favorite Canadian vacation spot, the resort town of Whistler, to find out if there are bachelors who have girlfriends. You can read the full recap here . Basically, Ed opted for his career and left the show while a brokenhearted Jillian eliminated Mark . In the sixth episode of The Bachelorette , the final eighth bachelors are treated to an exclusive private train ride on the famed Rocky Mountaineer---with breathtaking stops along the way. For tonight, there will be two crucial individual dates and one group date so fans can expect that roses are up for grabs. And as expected, if a bachelor does not receive a rose on the individual dates, he must get off the train the next station. Jillian kicks off her one-on-one date by inviting one suitor to her private car before they enjoy an intimate dinner under the domed roof of the observation car. However, this doesn't discourage one bachelor from sneaking around Jillian's private car late at night for some much-desired alone time. On the other hand, Jillian invites the six bachelors to snowshoe to a beautiful mountain lodge for cocktails and serious conversation. Five of the men, however, are unanimous that one particular remaining bachelor is really not on The Bachelorette for the right reason and they don't understand why Jillian can't see it. Jake, 31, commercial pilot from Dallas, TX. The eight remaining men are: Jesse , 27, wine maker from Carmel Valley, CA. Kiptyn , 31, business developer from Encinitas, CA. Michael , 25, break dance instructor from Astoria, NY.  2009-06-22T11:03:00   Tivo Mom  So you predict Robby and Jake. I see Robby going home but I really liked Jake. Can't wait to see.  Canadian Tourism   2009-06-23T13:48:00  The train ride through the Rocky Mountains is truly majestic .

In Bangladesh, an Islamic Movement With Al-Qaeda Ties Is on the Rise http://www.albd.org/autoalbd/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&i...; By Selig S. Harrison While the United States dithers, a growing Islamic fundamentalist movement linked to al-Qaeda and Pakistani intelligence agencies is steadily converting the strategically located nation of Bangladesh into a new regional hub for terrorist operations that reach into India and Southeast Asia. With 147 million people, largely Muslim Bangladesh has substantial Hindu and Christian minorities and is nominally a secular democracy. But the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) struck a Faustian bargain with the fundamentalist party Jamaat-e-Islami five years ago in order to win power. In return for the votes in Parliament needed to form a coalition government, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia has looked the other way as the Jamaat has systematically filled sensitive civil service, police, turn looked the other way as Jamaat-sponsored guerrilla squads intelligence and military posts with its sympathizers, who have in patterned after the Taliban have operated with increasing impunity in many rural and urban areas. coveted post of industries minister to Matiur Rahman Nizami, a high- To the dismay of her business supporters, the prime minister gave the ranking Jamaat official who has helped promote the growth of a Jamaat economic empire that embraces banking, insurance, trucking, pharmaceutical manufacturing, department stores, newspapers and TV stations. A study last year by a leading Bangladeshi economist showed that the "fundamentalist sector of the economy" earns annual profits of some $1.2 billion. Now the BNP-Jamaat alliance is rigging the next national elections, scheduled for January, to prevent the return of the opposition Awami League to power. Voter lists are being manipulated, and the supposedly neutral caretaker government and the commission that will run the election are being turned into puppets. The BNP argues that coalition rule helps moderates in the Jamaat to combat Islamic extremist factions. But the reality is that Jamaat inroads in the government security machinery at all levels, starting with Home Secretary Muhammad Omar Farooq, widely regarded as close to the Jamaat, have opened the way for suicide bombings, political assassinations, harassment of the Hindu minority, and an unchecked influx of funds from Islamic charities in Saudi Arabia and the Persian With some 15,000 hard-core fighters operating out of 19 known base camps, guerrilla groups sponsored by the Jamaat and its allies were able to paralyze the country last Aug. 17 by staging 459 closely synchronized explosions in all but one of the country's administrative 24 showed them lounging on a rug, conducting classes in bombmaking. free to receive visitors. A cartoon in the Daily Star of Dhaka on July Their fate and present place of confinement is uncertain, and all of the major guerrilla groups are back to business as usual. The bitterness of Bangladeshi politics is often attributed to a personal vendetta between two strong women, Prime Minister Zia and the Awami League leader, Sheikh Hasina Wajed. But the roots of the current struggle go back to 1971, when Bengali East Pakistan, led by the Awami wing, opposed the independence movement and fought side by side with nation of Bangladesh. The Jamaat, which originated in the western Pakistani forces against both fellow Bengalis and the Indian troops who intervened in the decisive final phase of the conflict. For Pakistan's intelligence agencies, especially Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the legacy of the independence war has been a built-in network of agents within the Jamaat and its affiliates who can be utilized to harass India along its 2,500-mile border with Bangladesh. In addition to supporting tribal separatist groups in northeast India, the ISI uses Bangladesh as a base for helping Islamic extremists inside India. After the July 11 train bombings in Bombay, a top Indian police official, K.P. Raghuvanshi, said that his key suspects "have connections with groups in Nepal and Bangladesh, which are directly or indirectly connected to Pakistan." A State Department report cited evidence that one of the Jamaat's main allies, the Harakat ul-Jihad-i-Islami, also headquartered in Pakistan, "maintains contact with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan." Bangladesh Harakat leader Fazlul Rahman was one of the six signatories of Osama bin Laden's first declaration of holy war against the United States, on Feb. 23, 1998. Since the October 2002 Bali bombings led to repression of al-Qaeda, some of its Indonesian and Malaysian cells have shifted their operations to Bangladesh. What makes future prospects in Bangladesh especially alarming is that the Jamaat and its allies appear to be penetrating the higher ranks of the armed forces. Among many examples, informed journalists in Dhaka Intelligence anti-terrorism bureau. The respected journalists in question cannot write freely about the Jamaat without facing death threats or assassination attempts. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists has published extensive dossiers documenting 68 death threats and dozens of bombing attacks that have injured at least eight journalists. "We are alarmed by the growing pattern of intimidation of journalists by Islamic groups in Bangladesh," the committee said recently. "As a result of its alliance with the Jamaat-Islamiyah, the government appears to lack the ability or will to protect journalists from this new and grave threat." The Bush administration has yet to speak with comparable candor. The latest State Department annual report on terrorism mentioned only one of the three Jamaat militias as a terrorist group and avoided direct criticism of the BNP for its coalition with the Jamaat, referring only to the "serious political constraints" that explain the government's "limited success" in countering "escalating" terrorist violence. On July 13 the U.S. ambassador called Bangladesh "an exceptional moderate last year. There is still time for the administration to use aid The United States and other donors gave Bangladesh $1.4 billion in aid leverage and trade concessions to promote a fair election by calling openly and forcefully for nonpartisan control of the Election Commission and the caretaker government. In addition to implicitly Musharraf for democratic elections because it needs the limited but In Pakistan, the United States has been gingerly pushing Gen. Pervez significant support he is giving against al-Qaeda and fears what might come after him.

CONTEXT	 Retired Adm. Charles Larson, a two-time superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, who signed the statement with 104 other retired admirals and generals, said in an interview Larson said he hoped Obama would take more time to work with the Pentagon. Joining Larson among the signatories was Clifford Alexander, Army secretary under former President Jimmy Carter, "There are a lot of issues they'll have to work out, and I think they'll have to prioritize," Larson said, noting that the next administration will face immediate combat-readiness and budget problems. "But I hope this would be one of the priority issues in the personnel area," Larson said. Larson, who has a gay daughter he says has broadened his thinking on the subject, believes a generational shift in attitudes toward homosexuality has created a climate where a repeal is not only regulations on the books to enforce proper standards of human tolerant, and they believe, as I do, that we have enough behavior," Larson said.

CONTEXT	 I expect a couple of Reese South Carolina sightings. Her family has a house in Charleston which is only a one and a half hour drive away from Columbia. Also expect her to stay the entire week when her husband has the kids for Fathers Day. Last year he had them for a week straight.  2008-04-13T09:13:00   sallykirkland  While the movie and its crew are scheduled to be in Columbia for ten weeks, maybe Jake is not scheduled to be there the entire ten weeks. His part might require less time then that. Reese's Schedule does seem clear...Maybe she's doing that for when the kids are out of school. Lots of time for MV, Ojai,and SC.  2008-04-14T09:01:00   Anonymous  Jake will probably be mostly based in Columbia, since it is a stand-in for Washington, D.C. He probably won't be needed for the entire ten solid weeks. I get a feeling that separations are getting harder for these two.Good!  2008-04-14T10:09:00   agent_krycek  they'll be filming in a building on the statehouse grounds in Columbia for the next 3 days That sound like a possible Washington stand in building?

Jake must be in town!  2008-04-14T17:09:00   UltraViolet  Anyone in Columbia should keep your eyes peeled around Sumter Street : Columbia police say they have closed a street in the Downtown area while shooting on the Jessica Biel and Jake Gyllenhaal movie, "Nailed," is being filmed this week. Officials with the City of Columbia Police Department say that Sumter Street between Gervais and Pendleton Streets will be closed until Sunday, April 20, at 11 p.m. The street closed early Monday morning. Some of the information i've read about the film though seems contradictory. First, Jessica Beil in Charleston. This contradicts everything else we know about filming this week. Charleston is no where near Columbia. Personally I don't think she was there at all. Or she was just vacationing before she started filming and the person who met her misunderstood her when she said that Jessica would be filming in Charleston for the week. Maybe Jessica just said South Carolina and the waitress assumed it was in Charleston. Second, filming at the state house. I don't know if this is true or not, but another report had them closing down a street for the full week. That street, Sumter, is where USC (University of South Carolina) is located. I vaguely remember reading that one of the locations they'd be filming at was one of the Universities.

CONTEXT	 Another gym sighting : Jake is in Columbia filming a new movie with Jessica Biel at the Capitol Building, which is a few blocks away. I guess he needed a gym to keep in shape at, and we just happened to be in the right place at the right time! I wish I had a picture to show how hot and muscular he was. I think it's safe to say we ALL wish that. That house scremaed more family, than single and I bet he had Reese and the kids in mind. How long is the drive from Columbia to Charleston? So if those comments on Perez Hilton are accurate, it seems that they're no longer staying at those houses. It might explain Jake's grumpiness. lol. I've thought for a while that Jake has been upset about the addresses to his houses being published. In fact it's happened three times in the last month or so. It happened with his regular house around the time his parents put their house up for sale. That real estate blog published the nearby street Jake lived on. It happened with Reese and Jake's Ojai house and now the one in Columbia. I think that's why he's mad. I almost posted a comment after we saw the pics of J & R and kids at LAX on their return from Cabo. I was thinking how important it was that J & R didn't go ballistic on the paps. (I cannot imagine how difficult is must be for them to control their natural instincts!) But kids totally pick up on their parents' emotions and reactions...... and if J & R allowed themselves to get visibly upset and "lose it", it would only scare the kids more than they already were. Children need to trust that their parents are in control and can keep them safe. I feel for Reese (and Jake to a lesser extent)..... parenting is hard enough without the burden of having to "teach" your young children how to live life with paparazzi! And I agree that some of Jake's grumpiness is most likely due to losing his family friendly house in Columbia. I think the rest of it is because he and Reese don't like being apart..... :( Oh, and TY to sallykirkland for the heads up regarding rumors of Reese in Charleston..... wouldn't surprise me a bit if it turns out to be true!

CONTEXT	 2010-01-22T06:28:00   Glenn Dunks  I went and saw Rob Marshall's Nine this afternoon. At first I thought I had walked into the wrong cinema since in the second row from the back of the quite small cinema they were screening the movie in sat a row of what looked to be 16-year-olds. Three girls and four boys. I don't know if they knew what movie they were going to see and I imagined similar scenes to when I saw Sweeney Todd and five minutes in a young guy screamed out "WHY ARE THEY SINGING?" before cursing Tim Burton during the closing credits.  Not to sound stalker-like, but I wanted to make sure to follow them once the credits roled because I was legitimately intrigued as to what their reactions would be. Throughout the movie I noticed on the guys was clearly infatuated with Penelope Cruz and her assets - wouldn't you be at 16? sexually confused or not - while one of the girls thoughts Daniel Day-Lewis was "gross!" when he removed his shirt and sat in a spa with a cardinal. As for myself? I can't say I'm not disappointed, but I also can't say I wasn't warned and that I didn't walk in with lowered expectations. It met them. Marion Cotillard warrants devotion for this performance and she was almost good enough to make me forget (at least momentarily) how completely retched La Vie on Rose was, and she in it. Penelope Cruz is fine even if she is playing the exact same everything from Vicky Cristina Barcelona , while the rest of the female cast all fill their spot with no major pros or cons. Daniel Day-Lewis on the other hand, as Guido Contini, lands firmly in the con side of the debate. What a bizarre performance. He is an incredibly handsome man so I'm not sure why they made him ugly and greasy. That singing voice wasn't exactly sparkling like a diamond either, was it? The songs are about 50/50. I had no prior knowledge of the stage show's score. I am aware that they took a few key numbers out, such as the title track, but I found it odd that the best song was one of the new tracks, "Take It All", performed by Marion Cotillard. In fact, Cotillard gets the two best numbers from the film along with "My Husband Makes Movies". The biggest problem with the musical numbers is the way they are edited. Kidman's "Unusual Way" and Cotillard's "Take it All", especially, which cut back and forth from the fantasy stage within Day-Lewis' mind and the real world. It breaks the flow of the songs and is particularly frustrating when the songs could have so easily been situated within this real world as characters breaking into song instead of them appearing in Contini's mind. If Rob Marshall makes another musical in the future, and I hope he does since Chicago is so excellent, then I hope he ditches this idea that musical sequences must be performed on the stage within the mind. On a technical level the film is ace. Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes and so on all all fabulous, but the film's lack of an arc makes it all feel incredibly flat. The Guido Contini of the opening five minutes is the same Guido Contini all the way through until the epilogue. An epilogue that felt like it should have been a big musical number ala Bob Fosse's own take on 8 1/2 , All That Jazz . Alas, it just ends. And so it goes. B-  2010-01-23T00:38:00   Andrew: Encore Entertainment  Maury Yeston's score has surprisingly turned into a great divider with the musical, countless reviewers have singled out their dissatisfaction with the score. But he's certainly not for all. I still have to see this, but Nine I could understand Marshall's plight because the musical is definitely one that works better on stage. Still, glad to see good words for Marion.  2010-01-25T19:59:00  Owen, was that directed at me? I didn't take it too seriously - and I have been on endlessly defending the film as not being a "remake" of 8 1/2 as some people have been claiming - but there are big issues with the movie right out there in the open. And, unfortunately, it wasn't as "fun" as Marshall's own Chicago .

Moreover, the NATO secretary general, who earlier visited the alliance troops in the western and southern Afghanistan, emphasized that Afghanistan belongs to Afghans and the Afghan people have to shoulder the responsibility to rebuild this war-

The disease, known officially as Phytophthora infestans, causes large mold-ringed olive-green or brown spots on plant leaves, blackened stems, and can quickly wipe out weeks of tender care in a home garden.

CONTEXT	 Dennis C. Blair said that a newly created team of elite interrogators should have been called in to question Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, and that top officials in Washington should have been consulted. The director of national intelligence also acknowledged that there had been a number of blunders in the handling of intelligence data that prevented authorities from stopping the incident. Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian, is accused of attempting to bomb a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. In testimony before the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Blair said that the interrogation group "was created exactly for this purpose. . . . We did not invoke [its use] in this case. We should have." "We know that those interrogations can provide critical intelligence," she said. "But the protections afforded by our civil justice system . . . encourage terrorists to lawyer up. I'm told that with Abdulmutallab, once he was 'Mirandized' and received civilian lawyers . . . he stopped answering questions." Collins and other lawmakers also questioned the decision to try Abdulmutallab in a civilian court rather than move him into military custody to face a tribunal. Abdulmutallab has pleaded not guilty to various charges in federal court in Detroit.

CONTEXT	  Roger Fraley   2008-08-20T06:38:00  The cornerstone of a democratic society is a well educated populace. When the populace is wholly misinformed about things, other things go poorly. Here is an important article about just how misinformed the Brits are about current and historical facts regarding America. The first line mentions crime statistics, but I can find no mention of it in the rest of the article. (It's here ) I'm sure most British citizens are indeed ignorant of the hugely rising crime rate in all categories but murder there while we have been undergoing a continuing decline (with fits and starts) for the past few decades. I'm struck by the congruence of lefty talking points and the mistaken beliefs of the Brits. You don't think the BBC had anything to do with the dissemination of all this invidious propaganda against the United States? Here is what the bulk of Brits believed followed by the the reality: 70% believe the US reduced CO2 less than the EU did since 2000--The US reduced it more. 80% believe the US sold Saddam at least 25% of his weapons--The real figure is .46%. Most believe that, since WWII, the US has backed non Muslims over Muslims in conflicts between them--We've supported the Muslims in 11 out of 12 conflicts. Most believe polygamy is legal--All 50 states ban even bigamy. Many believe the United States executes more criminals than China--China has more than ten times the executions. A third believe that a British citizen is more safe from assault than an American citizen--The Brit is more than twice as likely to be assaulted than an American. Nearly half believe that a white applicant to college will be accepted over a black applicant with the same qualifications--The opposite is true. It is little wonder the Brits look down on their former colonial cousins.  ????-??-??T12:30:00   Praguetwin  So who is responsible for American ignorance (i.e over half believe that Saddam Hussein was directly responsible for the events on 9/11)?  ????-??-??T13:58:00  It's not that high and it's not that Saddam plotted to bring down the buildings, but that he was involved in the al Qaeda plot. I believe the belief comes from the Atta meeting in Prague. I forget, has the Czech spy organization backed down from the claim?  ????-??-??T13:59:00  But to answer your question, the largely liberal teachers and the largely liberal news media are responsible for the ignorance in America. There certainly is plenty of it. I refuse to answer the Atta meeting question on the grounds that I've answered it for you explicitly many, many times. So I suppose it was the liberal teachers that wanted everyone to believe that Saddam supported al Qaeda.  ????-??-??T07:12:00   Anonymous  Saddam DID support Al Qaeeda....he wanted in on the organization. Zarqawi ring a bell ? Al Qaeda was not a fan of his, but they would have used him as a useful apostate. Mark Dunn  ????-??-??T07:32:00  I take it that's a no then, Mike. Zarqawi is like the Ray Crock of al Qaeda. Tony and I have argued about the existence of al Qaeda in Iraq before we invaded 3/03 but it's just that he called it something else before that date. Still was a terrorist connection and I believe across the supposedly impenetrable Shia/Sunni divide.  ????-??-??T08:22:00  There was al Qaeda in Yemen, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and at least a dozen other countries prior to 9/11. That isn't the point. Saddam had nothing to do with the attacks, and even Dick Cheney will admit that now. It is only you guys living with your heads under rocks that still cling to this myth.  ????-??-??T09:34:00  I'm not under a rock to believe that Saddam supported terrorism. He paid $25000 to the families of sicide bombers in Israel. He ran a retirement community for old terrorists. He at the very least allowed the late Z man to set up a terrorist training camp in Iraq. I believe he actively supported Z. Support and joined in on the planning are not the same thing. Rog, al Zarqawi just called it something else? He was a terrorist but had no affliation w/ al Qaeda until he made his declaration. Saddam gave money to suicide bombers who attacked Israel. He had nothing to do w/ 9/11. Never in life complain about "liberal" teachers when you are so ready to revise history to suit your politics. T

CONTEXT	10,000 military missiles by Slovakia to Sri Lanka. Come now BBC can an anti arms trade campaigning group who has criticised the sale of you not do better than sing in unison with an canary who sounds as though he just might be on the payroll of the Tamil Tiger terrorists in their desperate hour ? According to credible reports (if the credibility of the BBC is that  unquestionable!) Symon Hill, from the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), has said the sale was "exactly what Sri Lanka doesn't need at the moment". Curiously though! he has hadly touched on the burning of rank ignorance or steeped in bias in favour of the terrorists. No eradicating terrorists, may be used against civilians is a statement rocket science necessary while no pun is intended! Mr Hill has used the age old excuse with no tangible evidence or true the Armed Forces even at this very moment taking out in great numbers concocted or falsely portrayed but there are indeed many examples of terrorists who are an impediment to the smooth functioning and well being of Sri Lanka and its citizens and if further fortification of the Armed resources towards this task is necessary it has to be of no they could very well be supporting the terrorist cause rather than concern to Mr Hill, The BBC or anyone else who harp on the theme as condoning the urgent need of Sri Lanka to make redundant through military means the scourge which continues to threaten the Sovereign Right towards existence and the unitarity of Sri Lanka ! Civilian casualties most unfortunately are inevitable but may it be known that the Government takes every precaution to protect them but the task never made easy as the LTTE by choice and premeditation target A somewhat myopic reference has been made regarding the Code of conduct of the Government of Sri Lanka where certain pundits in accordance with the trend of thought expressed both by the BBC as well as the obstreperous Mr Hill, in the guise of being self acclaimed attempting to penetrate other global locales which have decided to ban waivable the independent observers in complaint might also consider journalists for various reasons of which there are countless examples so why the emphasis on Sri Lanka engaged in a war with nation threatening dangerous terrorists? What of Burma, Tibet, Zimbabwe and more( lesser entities towards the indemnities) where overall most unfortunately hearsay rules but nevertheless a fact of life where Sri Lanka deserves more than acollades for the concessions to Foreign Journalists( and unwelcome dignitaries) who in turn and in rank ingratitude sometimes report pure blarney laced in bias!! The European Union, of which Slovakia is a member indeed has a Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, designed "to prevent the export of equipment which might be used for internal repression or international of conduct. Slovakia isn't the only country that appears to have broken the code" but the bi partisanship of the EU relative to its stance on Sri Lanka of late points to the unimportance of any code which could more than fortify National Security! The European Union's response to Mr Hill in retrospect however stands to reason as well as being correct in saying that "how the code is implemented is up to each member country. The Slovakian Economy emphatically the Ministry spokesman Branislav Zvara has said that "the Ministry denies that the sale is in violation of the code where UN Security Council's evaluation of the situation in Sri Lanka has not led it to declare an embargo on arms shipments to the country" and perhaps reason enough for Mr Hill to put up something more plausible whether the three-metre missiles are designed to be dispatched from Final Note~ It should be of no consequence to the BBC or Mr Hill multiple rocket launchers, missile carrying attack craft or for that matter old world catapults mounted atop bullock Carts as it is a matter concerning the Security of a Sovereign Nation in defence of its the Sovereign right of Sri Lanka to defend itself from terrorists and likely be a creation of pro LTTE sympathy and worthless if it opposes Sovereignity, Territorial Integrity and National Security from terrorists and to even dare insinuate that the danger involved would

The AP reports: New York's top court has rejected a Christian legal group's challenge to some government benefits provided to legally married same-sex couples living in New York. The court avoided declaring that same-sex couples are entitled to all the rights of other married couples in the ruling released Thursday. New York doesn't allow same-sex marriage, so the ruling applies to couples married elsewhere. The case was pushed by the Alliance Defense Fund of Scottsdale, Ariz. In a written opinion, Judge Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick warns the effect of the decision will be to allow an unworkable pattern of conflicting orders by public officials involving different benefits and rights. The New York Times describes the ruling as a "narrow" and "small" victory for gay advocates as it applies only to the specifics of the case.

The Secret Service is following up on media reports today that someone in the crowd at a McCain/Palin event suggested killing Barack Obama, according to Secret Service spokesman Malcolm Wiley. The shout of "kill him" followed a Sarah Palin rant on Obama's relationship with radical Chicagoan Bill Ayers. Wiley says the Secret Service did not begin looking into the matter until press reports, namely Dana Milbank's article in the Washington Post, surfaced today, because no agents at the event heard anything. "The Secret Service did not hear any threatening statements directed at Radar. Also unclear: whether the remark was directed at Obama or Ayers if the words were actually "kill" and "him." Wiley said that the Secret Service had tried to get in touch with Milbank to get his account of the event but was unsuccessful.

CONTEXT	 Olympics: First family of taekwondo launch gold hunt The United States' first family of taekwondo kicked off their history-making gold hunt at the Beijing Olympics with solid wins in the men's and women's featherweight first rounds on Thursday.Mark Lopez, the 2005 world champion, swept aside Afghanistan's Nesar Ahmad Bahave 3-0 in his -68kg bout while sister Diana, also a 2005 world champion, whipped Thailand's Chonnapas Premwaew 2-0 in the women's -57kg division. Their older brother and four-time world champion, Steven, launches his campaign for a third straight Olympic gold on Friday in the men's -80kg welterweight division. Mark, 26, was to meet European bronze medallist Daniel Manz of Germany in the quarter-finals, with Taiwan's world champion Sung Yu-Chi on course to reach the final from the other block. "I just played my game and got into my rhythm. I'll just take one fight at a time," Mark said. Diana, 24, faced a second match against Turkey's Azize Tanrikulu, the 2005 European 59-63kg champion. Tanrikulu's older brother Bahri was due to fight Steven in the -80kg first round hoping to avenge his loss to the American in the gold-medal fight in Athens four years ago. Jean Lopez, himself a world silver medallist in 1995, said it was "a miracle" to have the four siblings at the Games. The Lopezs are the first trio of siblings to represent the United States at the same Olympics in the same sport since the Tritschler brothers competed in gymnastics at the 1904 Games in St Louis 104 years ago. Although none of the Tritschlers won a medal, the Lopez family have already struck gold together when they triumphed at the 2005 world championships to become the first three siblings in any sport to claim world titles at the same competition. Steven has competed and won at every Olympics since the Korean- born martial art made its Games debut in 2000 -- in the 68kg division in Sydney and in the 80kg class in Athens. It is the first Games for Mark and Diana.

CONTEXT	 Be suspicious of companies you don't understand or whose financials are opaque. In fact, unless you understand the business model, don't buy it at all. Sure, Buffett has invested in Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), and it will probably turn out like many other Buffett investments. But unless you fully understand Goldman's investment portfolio -- which seems almost impossible right now -- it's difficult to be confident that the business is rock-solid. The same sort of reasoning applies to retail banks such as Citigroup (NYSE: C) and bond insurers such as Ambac (NYSE: ABK). If you can't assess the risk, you can't be confident in the investment -- especially when blood is flowing like water.

CONTEXT	 Third, on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian line, vigorous electoral campaigns are under way. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has abandoned Likud, established a new centrist party that leads all the others in the polls, effectively marginalized those remaining Israelis who want to hold on forever to all the territories, and set Israel on a path to a modest and attainable territorial solution to the century-old conflict. As a result, Israel's regional isolation is easing, as Islamic countries from Pakistan to Qatar to Morocco openly extend or intensify relations, while anti-Israel rejectionists such as Syria and Hezbollah are isolated and even condemned by name in the U.N. Security Council. How did this come about? Israel unilateralism and Palestinian maturation.

CONTEXT	 While the President's very first campaign commercial used photos of coffin draped corpses (4) being pulled from the rubble, the White House has sought to hide evidence that Ground Zero firefighters and cops were exposed to hazardous toxins. Specifically, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) intervened to doctor EPA press releases (5) that were supposed to warn the public about toxins near Ground Zero. The press releases were modified to claim that the air was safe - despite the fact that there was not adequate scientific evidence to substantiate that claim. The CEQ was headed by James Connaughton, a former asbestos industry lawyer who represented companies in toxic pollution cases (6). When Ground Zero firefighters and cops began getting sick, the White House tried to block $90 million in funding (7) for medical treatment. When Congress forced the Administration to accept the $90 million, the Administration then delayed the money (8) and threatened to shut down the health-screening program. Even today, the New York Police Department has been denied much needed health grants (9). Sources Daily Mislead : 2.

Bush Ignores Sick 9/11 Firefighters & Cops Over the last month, President Bush has repeatedly recounted how he was inspired by "the courage of the firefighters and the police"(1) in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks. He recounted how, when standing atop a pile of rubble at Ground Zero, he was told by a firefighter, "Don't let me down" (2). But more than two years later, he continues to ignore the needs of firefighters and police officers who are now suffering adverse health effects from their rescue efforts at Ground Zero. The situation has reached a head: yesterday, 1,700 cops and firefighters were forced to sue in court for the medical help they desperately need (3.)

CONTEXT	 PISCO, Peru 2007-08-19 14:56:02 UTC Military trucks carrying supplies were swarmed Saturday by dozens of people in the port city of Pisco, and survivors fought over cans of tuna and cartons of milk. In a soccer stadium, more than 500 people lined up at a lone truck that passed out packets of Authorities set up a number of food distribution points in Pisco but very little aid seemed to be arriving to the estimated 80,000 people affected by the quake. He said food donated by one Lima district had been sacked on the traffic-clogged highway before it could reach Pisco. "These are just people taking advantage." Defense Minister Allan Wagner told The Associated Press on Saturday in Pisco that the death toll had risen to 540, up from the previous figure of 510 provided by firefighters. Destruction was centered in Peru's southern desert, the oasis city of Ica and nearby Pisco, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of the capital of Lima. Wagner said the number of soldiers in Pisco would be increased from 400 to 1,000. The remaining 400 soldiers from the new deployment would go to other areas. Motorcycle taxi driver Marco Coila said he had moved his family out of Pisco to a village where they hoped to find more food, but found little there. In the Paracas National Reserve, a wildlife sanctuary on the coast near Pisco, a rock monument known as "The Cathedral" was severely damaged when a chunk of the formation that juts out into the Pacific Ocean chipped off during the quake. Associated Press writers Monte Hayes, Leslie Josephs and Edison Lopez in Lima and Jeanneth Valdivieso in Pisco contributed to this report.

CONTEXT	 Jonathan Freedland writes for the Guardian...in this piece he criticizes the left for not condemning anti-semitism. Please note that Freedland is highly critical of Israel's conduct in the latest war.... At the London events, there were multiple placards deploying what has now become a commonplace image: the Jewish Star of David equated with the swastika. From the podium George Galloway declared: "Today, the Palestinian people in Gaza are the new Warsaw ghetto, and those who are murdering them are the equivalent of those who murdered the Jews in Warsaw in 1943." Now what, do you imagine, is the effect of repeating, again and again, that Israel is a Nazi state? Even those with the scantest historical knowledge know that the Nazis are the embodiment of evil to which the only appropriate response is hate. How surprising is it if a young man, already appalled by events in Gaza, walks home from a demo and glimpses the Star of David - which he now sees as a latter-day swastika - outside a synagogue and decides to torch the building, or at least desecrate it? Yet Galloway, along with Livingstone, who was so careful in July 2005, did not hesitate to make the comparison (joined by a clutch of Jewish anti-Israel activists who should know better).

CONTEXT	 Paramount and Marvel Extend Distribution Deal Under the agreement, Paramount will take a smaller distribution fee from Marvel -- 8 percent -- rather than the 10 percent it had received for releasing "Iron Man" in exchange for gaining worldwide distribution rights to the pictures. Paramount, which released the action movie in the U.S. and Canada and other overseas territories,  also  will distribute Marvel's films in such key markets as Japan, Germany, France, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. Previously, Marvel had licensed distribution rights to local distributors in those territories. Paramount will distribute "Iron Man 2," due out May 7, 2010, worldwide with the exception David Maisel, chairman of Marvel Studios, a unit of publicly traded Marvel Entertainment Inc., said that given the success of "Iron Man," it made sense to continue the distribution pact with Paramount on "improved economic terms." By releasing through one worldwide distribution partner, Maisel said Marvel believes it can "maximize the upside" of its movies. In a regulatory filing Monday, Marvel said that it had received its first "Iron Man" check from Paramount in the amount of $60 million. The company forecast revenue in its film production Marvel, which used to rely on studios to bankroll its movies, has been self-financing its pictures since securing a $525 million deal with Merrill Lynch & Co. in 2005.

Your donation to FAIR goes a long way.  Help us hold mainstream On April 2, the New York Times noticed a trend that, if true, would indeed be worth celebrating. Under the headline "Like the Candidates, TV's Political Pundits Show Signs of Diversity," reporter Felicia Lee told readers: "With campaign coverage center stage on the cable channels, producers and critics are again assessing the diversity among pundits, who talk (and talk) about things like Mr. Obama's pastor, the Hispanic vote, Iraq and the economy." Lee added: "Both MSNBC and CNN this election season have given new prominence to a handful of contributing commentators from varied backgrounds and perspectives: blacks, Hispanics and women." That sounds good--until the Times gets around to telling you more about these fresh new faces. And then you learn that diversity has a somewhat limited definition in the corporate media. In total, the Times listed 16 pundits who represent this supposedly fresh approach to political analysis. Ten were African-Americans; four of them were conservative or Republican strategists, six were Democratic strategists or progressives, but two of the latter--Juan Williams of NPR and Fox, and Democratic Leadership Council head Harold Ford--are probably best described as centrist or conservative Democrats. The relevant context for this broadening of the pundit lineups on TV is, of course, the presidential election. But in that context of national politics, what's really striking is that the communities that are being represented here--blacks, Latinos and women--really aren't being represented. All three groups tend to vote Democratic; since 1992, exit polls have shown women picking Democratic presidential candidates over Republicans by an average of 10 percentage points, Latinos choosing Democrats by 31 points and African-Americans voting Democratic by a dramatic 78 points. The Times cheered what it calls the "more saladlike pundit mix" available to viewers. The paper also said that CNN president Jon Klein thinks the fact that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are on the cusp of the Democratic nomination translates into more women and people of color on the air. That might be true, but it really only points back at the problem: Why do the media have to wait for the slow-motion march towards political diversity at the top of the political world before giving viewers and readers even a limited glimpse at diversity in the political discussion?

During Bobby's 20 years away from chess, a cottage industry among chess writers was to speculate why he wasn't playing.  All kinds of ideas were floated. was a favorite of the Soviets and some Western Evans never subscribed to the cowardice line that writers.  Fear did not enter Bobby's mind because reality for him was in the "I" of the Beholder. At the famous news conference in 1992, when asked why he didn't play for 20 years, Bobby said, in effect, that the question was all wrong. The issue was not why he had not played the rest of the world; the issue was why the rest of the world had not played him. Bobby had all kinds of fears, but they were not the fears of a personal coward shirking combat -- physical or intellectual. Bobby's words could not be taken as seriously meant, though they were seriously considered.  For example, he denounced Larry Evans in one of his radio the Sage of Reno. Too, Bobby evidently could respect the logic of an argument.  In an editorial that I wrote with Evans on whether Bobby were a criminal for playing in no way a criminal.  In spite of the biting personal man with whom one would shake hands but that he was in comment, Bobby put the entire piece on his website. Apropos of little, I remember an encounter between speaking Americans, who as a group, have a very nature, these newsgroups are dominated by English powerful *bias* in favor of Bobby Fischer.

CONTEXT	 What Bush Left Out of His Flat Farewell  2009-01-16T20:47:27   James <starj...@yahoo.com>  George W. Bush gave his final speech to the nation on Thursday night. I skipped it to see my daughter, who has known no other president, perform with her school chorus. But when I later sat before my television to see how the speech was being punditized on the cable news shows, I was surprised. The water-landing of a US Airways flight in New York City dominated the coverage. There was little chatter--almost nothing--about Bush's farewell. After watching the speech on the White House website, I understood why. It was flat and short. Bush said little of interest. He dwelled mostly on 9/11 and the so-called war on terror, once again (and for the last official time) terrorist attack on our soil." Was the nation's safety ensured because Bush invaded Iraq and did not finish the fight in Afghanistan? No doubt, he and his ever-dwindling band of defenders will continue to insist that it is so--just as a rooster might insist there is a connection between his crowing and the rising of the sun. And Bush defended himself for having been "willing to make the tough decisions"--as if making hard choices is the same as making wise ones. For most of the 13 minutes he spoke, Bush offered surface-level observations. He provided one quote, noting that President Thomas Jefferson once remarked, "I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past." It's no wonder Bush fancies this line. Given that he is passing to Barack Obama a country burdened with two unresolved wars and an economy in severe decline, Bush certainly would Ernest Hemingway, I believe, once observed that what one doesn't put on the page is as important as what one does. And what Bush did not discuss in his farewell address also defines his presidency. Here is a partial list: * China * Russia * North Korea * Foreclosures * Housing * Guantanamo * Immigration * Automobile industry What else is there to say? In the end, after eight long and traumatic years, Bush did not have much to tell us.

CONTEXT	China will take multiple steps to combat the falling price of  cotton, according to National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC), the country's top economy planner. Market statistics showed that the purchase price of standard cotton averaged 12,553 yuan per tonne (1,838 U.S. dollars) on Tuesday. That is 68 yuan lower than the previous trading day. "Both short-term and long-term measures are needed to stabilize the price of cotton, so as to protect the nation's cotton production as well as the interests of farmers," said NDRC's trade and commerce official Ma Zhanping at a cotton forum on Monday. According to Ma, the country will encourage commercial banks and rural credit institutions to provide more loans to fund cotton purchases. China is also expected to purchase more cotton and put it in a state reserve in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in hopes of slowing down falling cotton prices. "The textile industry has been suffering from shrinking global market demand. By giving subsidies to farmers, we could support the cotton industry while avoiding putting more pressures on textile and garment manufacturers," said Ma.

Some 35,000 people live in the southwestern Montana town that, in many ways, contrasts with the state's usual image of wide-open spaces, trout streams and cowboys. In Butte, visitors can pay US$2 (euro1.37) to see an old mining pit now filled with polluted water or take a guided tour of old brothels. "He was right up there with Elvis and Sinatra," said George Riojas of Butte. Riojas said he admired Knievel's ability to maintain an enduring image even when "we're always itching for a new face," and his loyalty to his hometown long after he moved

CONTEXT	 And I was (and am still) really, sincerely surprised that our journalists could pick up anything from the meaningless speech, let alone write full-length articles on it when I dozed off. Read Marina. Then it came to Khoo Kay Peng and Ungku Aziz on "Malaysian National Unity: Organic or Manufactured?". I thought Ungku Aziz was a bit kooky. Kay Peng was very passionate -- is he related to Khoo Kay Khim? The debate was okay lah but I thought it verved a bit (read: a lot) off-topic. Many questions were left unanswered and many answers were unsolicited. Read Khoo Kay Peng's account. Next was Zainah Anwar and Mazeni Alwi (Chairman, Muslim Professional Forum), "Reconciling Religion and Gender: The Malaysian Context". Zainah was amazing as usual but Mazeni's speech was all over the place. This guy begs to differ: (Emily and Su Ann and Wai Kin and Valerie and Emily yep it's that guy...) "Semakin lama saya dengar si feminis tersebut memukau para anak muda yang entah faham ke tidak akan fardhu ain agamanya sendiri serta ratusan rakan-rakan yang bukan Islam yang semakin pening, bingkas saya bangun dan menegur si feminis dan pengajur. Jikalau hendak berbicara sebegitu rupa letak satu ulama' atas pentas baru adil. Bagi saya pengajur MSLS gagal memahami realiti ini dengan membiar semahu-mahunya si feminis tersebut 'memperkosa' pemahaman Islam dihadapan kami pada hari itu." Again, you guys are smart enough to draw your own conclusions lah. But I do agree with him about inviting an ulama (ulama's actually plural in Arabic so in universal grammar this sentence is wrong) to MSLS. It would have been even more interesting to have invited an UMNO imam to debate a PAS imam and more importantly making them answer all our uncensored questions. Then I can ask them questions in Arabic to show off (and maybe suffer public embarassment myself when I realise that I've forgotten all my vocab). ;) Nik Aziz for MSLS III, perhaps? Also remember to invite the TM Net boss for MSLS III because I have damn a lot of questions to ask him about Streamyx. *** Khairy: (referring to Tony from DAP and Nik from PKR) I guess since UMNO is having talks with PAS I'll represent both UMNO and PAS. (which elicits a spontaneous audience booing) It was this humour and basic rowdiness that really made the debate great. Every good debater knows that when the bar for substance is equally high throughout the teams, what really makes for victory, what sets apart the creme de la creme is style. And that determines how memorable you are as a speaker as well. And Tony vs Khairy vs Nik was the epitome of styyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyle baybeee.

CONTEXT	 Obama strikes deep into McCain's turf as election nears Democrat Barack Obama on Sunday pursued his audacious hunt for votes in America's conservative heartland after rallying monster crowds in the Republican "red" state of Missouri with a rousing call for change. Just over a fortnight before the November 4 election, the White House hopeful was to campaign in North Carolina -- which last voted for a Democratic presidential contender in 1976 but is now a toss-up state. prepared to air an interview on its Sunday politics show "Meet And Obama's camp was hoping for a landmark endorsement as NBC the Press" with former secretary of state Colin Powell, a Republican military grandee. For the liberal left, Powell was tarnished by his role in promoting the US invasion of Iraq. But it would be a stern slap to Republican John McCain's candidacy if the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff backed Obama. McCain, fighting a rearguard offensive as his poll numbers sag, insisted that Obama's economic plan would "kill" job creation as the United States weathers its worst financial crisis in decades. "At least in Europe, the Socialist leaders who so admire my opponent are upfront about their objectives," he said Saturday, as his campaign bombarded voters' telephones with "robo-calls" But the Democrat, who is riding high in national and state polls, was buoyed by the astonishing numbers he attracted on Saturday in Missouri, which voted for Republican President George W. Bush in the last two elections. The day's first crowd in St Louis numbered at least 100,000 -- Obama's biggest yet in the United States. An evening rally in Kansas City, Missouri's other big metropolis, attracted more than The 47-year-old candidate bidding to be the nation's first black president said the enormous turnouts were proof "the winds are blowing for change across America," as he bids to flip red states blowing in North Carolina, they're blowing in Virginia, they're "They're blowing in Kansas, they're blowing in Missouri, they're blowing in Ohio," Obama said, reeling off a list of states that all backed Bush in 2004 and 2000. At his own rallies in North Carolina and Virginia, another red state now very much in play, McCain Saturday once again invoked Ohio plumber Samuel "Joe" Wurzelbacher, a new hero to conservatives after challenging Obama on taxes. Joe the Plumber and low taxes have become McCain's latest campaign motifs as the Arizona senator, 72, vies to resuscitate his flagging White House hopes on the final stretch to the McCain intensified an offensive in swing states over Obama's ties to former 1960s radical William Ayers. He unleashed automated phone calls that also accused Obama of supporting the killing of McCain himself was undermined by robo-call smears when he was up against Bush for the Republican nomination in 2000, and even party colleagues such as Maine Senator Susan Collins say the tactic smacks of desperation this time. But the McCain campaign insisted the attack calls were rooted in fact and said the Democratic contender was hoodwinking voters over his past. For his part, Obama said Americans "can't afford four more years like the last eight."

Al-Rawi was arrested in November 2002 while on a business trip to Gambia, where his supporters say he was helping his older brother Wahab set up a peanut oil processing business. News of Al-Rawi's release was announced by Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett in a written statement to parliament last week.

Another major fundraiser for Obama is William Ayers, who also sat on the board of the Woods Fund with Obama and is a professor at the University of Chicago. Bill Ayers, along with his wife Bernadine Dohrn, was an active member of the Weather Underground, a radical left- wing group that advocated violence against the United State. Both Ayers and Dohrn went "underground" in 1970 after others in the group accidentally detonated a bomb in a Greenwich Village (New York City) townhouse. The blast killed three of the group's members including Ayers' girlfriend at the time. While Ayers and Dohrn were hiding from law enforcement, the Weather Underground participated in the bombings of the US Capital, the Pentagon and a State Department building. In 1981 Ayers and Dohrn turned themselves in to federal authorities, but all charges were dropped as a result of alleged "government legal misconduct." In his 2001 memoir, Ayers wrote, "I don't regret setting the bombs. I feel we didn't do enough." Ayers and Dohrn are known to have held at least one fundraiser for Barack Obama in their Chicago home. In another suspected quid pro quo arrangement similar to those with Ayers and Rezko, Rashid Khalidi also held a fundraising event in his home for Barack Obama. university.

CONTEXT	 People don't want to see cult movies so advertising a film as one is cutting out all but the film geeks. @ PalaceFilms says "if it (the use of "cult") suggests Lebowski, Office Space or Napoleon D connotations - ripper Rita." That's all well and good, but Lebowski and Office Space were box office flops and you'll be hard pressed to find anybody who doesn't spend hours a day discussing film who has seen them, let alone liked them. Napoleon Dynamite on the other hand isn't "cult" at all. When your movie is a box office hit and has merchandise in Myer and Target, you're not longer cult. It's why Bruce Campbell has never had a proper career or why Troma films are always bad. They trade on "cult", but the audience for cult - by pure definition - is too small and to scream to everyone that your film is "destined for cult status" is to all but say "this film is destined to be watched on late night cable TV by people who read AICN!" It's a shame though because French Kissers looks better than that and while Lyndon was right in saying that "We can safely assume FRENCHKISSERS is not going to be m-stream hit in Oz," it's still a bad marketing method in my eyes. Why ally yourself with a word associated with failure? I've always had an aversion to the word "cult" in any movie marketing for these very reasons. I find it cheap and ultimately unsuccessful. Paranormal Activity hasn't stunted its growth by calling itself an "instant cult hit!" has it? No. If The French Kissers is as good - and as popular in its home country - as I have been lead to believe, why not trumpet that instead of its vague similarities to some movies that nobody saw? I believe I'm seeing The French Kissers next week some time so I'll try and chime in with whether there is anything remotely "cult" about it.

CONTEXT	Sustainable Seattle: City's Progress Towards Zero Waste  2009-04-01T15:52:17  by Amy Goodman and Richard Conlin  Amy Goodman: We’re in Seattle on our community media Standing Up the Madness tour; Juan Gonzalez is in New York. And sitting next to me today is Richard Conlin. He’s the president of the Seattle City Council, co-founder of the organization Sustainable Seattle. Two years ago, Richard Conlin launched the Zero Waste Strategy to improve the city’s recycling rate and advocated a twenty-cent fee on disposable shopping bags that was passed by the City Council. But the plastics industry and the Washington Food Industry launched a petition drive against the ordinance, and the issue is expected to be placed on the ballot for a public vote later this year. Richard Conlin: Thank you so much. It’s great to be here. Amy Goodman: It’s great to have you. Talk about this program that starts today. Richard Conlin: Well, we’ve actually been doing food waste composting for a while in the city, but today we inaugurate a universal collection for all single-family households, and all food waste can be put into it. It’s goi ng to be moving from a biweekly to a weekly model. We’re expanding from the 60,000 households who formerly participated to about 100,000 households participating today. We expect this to be a huge step forward in the Zero Waste Strategy. Amy Goodman: How does it work? Richard Conlin: Essentially, everybody gets a cart. You can get different sizes of carts, depending on what you’re going to be producing in your household. And then, the cart is picked up on a weekly basis. You can place all food and all food-related items into it. The food then gets taken off to a composting facility, and it becomes great soil. VIDEO: Richard Conlin talks about Seattle's green initiatives, promoting vibrant neighborhoods, sustainable community, fighting climate change, and protecting the environment. Amy Goodman: Talk about the situation for renewable—for composting for environmental policy in Seattle. Richard Conlin: Well, Seattle has a great group of citizens who are really committed to the environment. And we’ve been working for a long time to try and improve a lot of different things about the way in which we deal with environmental issues and into the concept of sustainability, which brings environment, economy, social justice and community together. So this is simply one step in making that And then the plastics industry came in, and they put $200,000 into a signature-gathering drive. It’s the most astonishing initiative drive I’ve seen. They paid $15 per signature. But they were able to get it and put it on the ballot. We have—this is a Progressive Era state, and so the people have the right to vote on these things. And we will be putting it on the ballot this August, actually. Amy Goodman: And where does—go ahead, Juan. Juan Gonzalez: In terms of the total amount of waste that Seattle produces, does it, like many cities, export its garbage to landfills or even out of state? day, we send a mile-long train of garbage out of Seattle to that landfill in eastern Oregon. It’s really an astonishing thing to have to deal with. Amy Goodman: And can you talk about how Seattle has become the first city in King County to mandate food and yard waste, to mandate the whole service that you have? Richard Conlin: We’ve been working on this for a long time, but we really had a tremendous spirit in our public that told us that we needed to do something a little bit more. We started recycling, curbside recycling, back in the early 1990s, late ’80s. And what happened was that as we were looking at redoing our transfer station system, we had a proposal to add a third transfer station to the two transfer stations we have. And we looked at that, and we said, “Why are we building new ways to dispose of garbage, when what we ought to be doing is finding ways in which to reduce the amount of garbage?” So instead of building that third transfer station, we created the Zero Waste Strategy. And we put this out for—to a public hearing, and we had hundreds of people show up, and basically nobody opposed it. The people of Seattle really believe that this is the direction, the kind of thing that we ought to be doing. Richard Conlin: Well, I’m not sure I can speak for the mayor, but what I can say from the council’s perspective is that there was an agreement negotiated with the group initially to allow the siting of a tent city. Clearly, what we’re looking for is to try and bring people out of homelessness. Our goal is to find ways in which to give people jobs, get people homes, get people places to live. Given that that’s a challenging goal, you always have to look at—so what are the things you do in the short term in order to make sure that people do have shelter? But the long-term goal is really clear. We don’t think that anybody should have to be homeless. Amy Goodman: Is there a permanent siting, going to be, for the Nickelsville? And how does the mayor feel about it being named for him? Richard Conlin: Well, you probably have to ask the mayor that one. But I would guess he’s not particularly enthusiastic about it. And I don’t think there’s likely to be a permanent siting for a tent city. The previous tent city does not have a permanent site. It moves on a regular basis from church lot to church lot and sometimes in non-church areas, as well. So I don’t think there’s a permanent site, and we really aren’t aiming for that. We’re aiming to try and find ways in which to help people get out of homelessnes s. That’s really the goal. Amy Goodman: And the overall policy of the Obama administration around renewable energy, around green jobs, how does that specifically affect Seattle? Richard Conlin: Well, we feel like we’re positioned very well to be—take the lead in the next economy, because Seattle has long had a commitment to developing green jobs. We’ve actually made environmentally sustainable business, which is our acronym we use for it, we made that one of our five target industries for development for the last several years. And so, there’s going to be great chances for us to do not only things like siting the manufacture of wind turbines and facilities for production of that, solar cells. All of those kind of things can be sited in Seattle. We’ve got some of those business here right now, the architectural and engineering firms that are around them, and many other kinds of green jobs, as well. So this is a great chance for us. And as the economy changes, as we move into the next stage of this economy, it’s a great way in which to bring together the environment and the economy. And we’ve got to get past that old dichotomy of saying there’s a conflict between them, because there isn’t. The fact is that that’s the only way in which we’re going to have a real economy for the future, is one that is environmentally responsible. Amy Goodman: Well, Richard Conlin, I thank you for joining us. Richard Conlin is20the president of the Seattle City Council. He is also the co-founder of the organization Sustainable Seattle. And he is on the board of YES! Magazine. This is Democracy Now!, as we broadcast on the road, beginning our, well, close to seventy-city tour right here in Seattle, Washington.

And here's the curious thing: Despite a lack catastrophe, despite the way much of the Iraq story fell off newspaper front pages and out of the TV news in the last year, despite so many reports on the "success" of the President's surge strategy, Americans sense this perfectly well. In the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll, 56% of Americans "say the United States should withdraw its military forces to avoid further casualties" and this has, as the Post notes, been a majority position since January 2007, the month that the surge was first announced. Imagine what might happen if the American public knew more about the actual state of affairs in Iraq -- and of thinking in Washington. So, here, in an attempt to unravel the situation in ever-unraveling Iraq are twelve contractors, and Defense Department civilian employees, and described north of Baghdad, which houses about 40,000 American troops, it as "one giant construction project, with new roads, sidewalks, and structures going up across this 16-square-mile fortress in the center of Iraq, all with an eye toward the next few decades." despite the endless talk about drawdowns and withdrawals, that administration that simply never expected to leave.

CONTEXT	 The 44-page report comes ahead of an international conference on climate change next month in Beijing, organized by the U.N. and the Chinese government to help promote the exchange of green technologies. It details what steps China has taken to ease pollution, and the costs to its agriculture and environment from rising temperatures. Even more crucial will be a meeting in December in Poland to start negotiations over what to do after the U.N.-backed Kyoto Protocol on climate change expires in 2012. Under the Kyoto Protocol, developing nations, such as India and China, were exempt from limits on greenhouse-gas emissions. Some rich countries, such as the U.S., which didn't join the treaty, said excluding poor countries basically added an unfair burden to rich nations while allowing poorer countries to keep polluting. China argues that because rich countries had contributed the bulk of greenhouse gasses during their industrialization, they should foot the bill for cleaning up. But when Kyoto was first negotiated, scientists had greatly underestimated the speed with which China's economy would grow.

CONTEXT	 The Pentagon is considering banning the use and sale of tobacco products for U.S. soldiers. Pentagon health experts are urging Defense Secretary Robert Gates to ban the use of tobacco by troops and end its sale on military property, a change that could dramatically alter a culture intertwined with smoking. Jack Smith, head of the Pentagon's office of clinical and program policy, says he will recommend that Gates adopt proposals by a federal study that cites rising tobacco use and higher costs for the Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs as reasons for the ban. The study by the Institute of Medicine, requested by the VA and Pentagon, calls for a phased-in ban over a period of years, perhaps up to 20. "We'll certainly be taking that recommendation forward," Smith says. A tobacco ban would confront a military culture, the report says, in which "the image of the battle-weary soldier in fatigues and helmet, fighting for his country, has frequently included his lit cigarette." Also, the report said, troops worn out by repeated deployments often rely on cigarettes as a "stress reliever." The study found that tobacco use in the military increased after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began. An estimated 37% of U.S. soldiers use tobacco and that number rises to more than 50% if the soldier has seen combat.

Between Tony Rezko, Obama's will hit), and William Ayers, the American people are going to be asked to make an assessment about Barack Obama's judgment to be president and commander in chief. If past is prologue, the Republicans (YouTube news clip) Mr. Ayers continues: "Certainly flirting with the idea of terrorism was off the tracks and a mistake. The fact that we never executed that flirtation is important and significant and I think conveniently forgotten, but we never did." In fact, Mr. Ayers and his cohorts did set off a bomb at the Pentagon. In his book, he writes: "It turns out that we blew up a bathroom and, quite by accident, water plunged below Ben Smith has done a piece today on the relationship. It's a story many of us have been following. The Ayers story goes back years, to Vietnam, a subject, no doubt, that John McCain will mine. After all, who better to attack the Democratic nominee than a war hero tortured in Vietnam, while equating Marines with "terrorists." Later in the talk, Mr. Ayers declared: "The fact is that there was an official policy of our government to create terrorism in Vietnam. . . . How you resisted that policy was a burning question, The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth won't have to make stuff up about Obama. His relationship with Ayers is a fact, as they also were both seated on a nine-member board of the Woods Fund in 1999, for three years. In lieu of that connection, even in the face of a measly $200 contribution from Ayers to Obama, as well as the Obama campaign's statement decrying Ayers' actions when he was with the terrorist group The Weather Underground, quotes like the one below from Ayers are a with him when launching your political career: Mr. Ayers wrote a memoir, "Fugitive Days," published in 2001, and on the day of the September 11 terrorist attacks, he was quoted by the New York Times as saying: "I don't regret setting bombs.

Unfortunately, that's not going to happen at this point. record, try as I might through many angles.

No doubt he won't be the last, because the Republicans are going to 2. Barack Obama has had a long standing relationship with Ayers and is quite knowledgeable of his past. 3. Barack and Ayers served together on the Wood Fund. I am told, but have not yet confirmed, that they steered money to an individual who is under Federal indictment. If that is true, life gets more which Republicans will seize. Why wouldn't they? Visualize Bush 41 and least I credited him. But what he is saying will indeed be an issue on Michael Dukakis, then think of the Obama - Ayers ad in the general election. It writes itself. The difference, however, is that Horton was a common murderer, while Ayers was a domestic terrorist who "I can remember being one of a small group of people who came to Bill Ayers' house to learn that Alice Palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for Congress," said Dr. Quentin Young, a prominent Chicago physician and advocate for single-payer health care, of the informal gathering at the home of Ayers and his wife, Bernardine Dohrn. "[Palmer] identified him as her successor." Obama and Palmer "were both there," he said. Obama's connections to Ayers and Dorhn have been noted in some fleeting news coverage in the past. But the visit by Obama to their home--part of a campaign courtship--reflects more extensive interaction than has previously reported. Neither Ayers nor the Obama campaign would describe the relationship between the two men. ... .. Obama's Ayers and Dorhn relationship is something more than a few people have been trying to nail down for weeks. You can bet the Republicans and their 527s will do just that. I don't blame them a lack of seriousness I will never accept. John McCain's personal our Marines "terrorists," while also being unrepentant about it, shows disgust at this connection between Obama and Ayers will bring out a righteous fury that will likely pit the War Hero against the Terrorist's Friend, which is just one angle Obama's opponents will use.

And that to me is not what I would call acceptable or campaign and supporters are walking into a political buzz saw. It's a set up waiting for Democrats.

Corporations like Time Warner, American Express and Merrill Lynch all have black CEOs. Is Tiger Woods not the world's No. 1 golfer? And say it ain't so, but didn't Snoop Dogg cut a Chrysler commercial? And sociologist Nathan Glazer says studies show three out of four blacks, with SAT scores between 1250 and 1299, receive admissions into the nation's most elite colleges, yet only one in four whites with comparable SAT scores receive admission. And isn't this 2006, with black candidates like Michael Steele, the lieutenant governor of Maryland, now running for the U.S. Senate? And isn't Ken Blackwell, Ohio's black secretary of state, running for governor? And what about Lynn Swann, the former Pittsburgh Steelers great, who just got the Republican nod for Pennsylvania's gubernatorial race? What about back-to-back black secretaries of State, one of whom, Condoleezza Rice, many hope and wish would run for president? Polls show over 90 percent of whites would vote for a qualified black presidential candidate, versus one-third in 1958.

CONTEXT	 Courtesy of the Tectonic Theater Project , today's Swag Tuesday prize is two tickets to the October 12th performance of The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later at NYC's Lincoln Center. The groundbreaking epilogue to the Laramie Project, titled THE LARAMIE PROJECT: 10 YEARS LATER, will be performed in New York at Lincoln Center and over 150 other theaters across the country on October 12, 2009. The Lincoln Center premiere will feature a pre-show that will be webcast live to the other productions and include guest host Glenn Close, welcoming remarks by Judy Shepard and a post-production Q and A moderated by National Public Radio Arts and Culture correspondent Neda Ulabay. “We now have over 150 theaters participating in this historic event and are thrilled to be joined by Judy Shepard, Glenn Close and our other special guests at the NY premiere” said Greg Reiner, Executive Director of the Tectonic Theater Project. “The interest and enthusiasm that the epilogue is receiving is very exciting and demonstrates to us the power the Shepard story still holds for people, as part of our collective history and as a lesson to all about homophobia, what is means to be gay in a small town and how stories must be re-told to ensure that the legacy of these kinds of incidents is correct,” continued Reiner. “The Laramie Project: 10 Years Later will engage the audience as did the original, and we expect there will be many who are surprised to learn what Laramie is like a decade after Matt’s murder,” concluded Reiner. The writers of this play are Tectonic Theater Project members Moisés Kaufman, Leigh Fondakowski, Greg Pierotti, Andy Paris, and Stephen Belber. Tickets to the event at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall are a very reasonable $100. Get tickets here . Enter to win two tickets by commenting on this post. Only enter once and please remember to leave your email address in the text of your comment. If you cannot be in NYC on October 12th, your winning entry is transferable to another party. Entries close at midnight Wednesday, west coast time. Publicists: If you'd like to take part in Swag Tuesday on JMG, please email me.

CONTEXT	 Lesbian and gay refugees who have suffered violent and sexual abuse in their home countries are being declared "failed" asylum seekers and scheduled for deportation by the Home Office. Among those due to be sent back are gay refugees from violently homophobic countries like Cameroon, Pakistan, Uganda, Sudan, Jamaica, Iran, Palestine, Algeria, Iraq, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Egypt. The desperate suffering of lesbians and gays who have fled from homophobic regimes, and their abuse by the Home Office, is the theme of today's protests in the UK, which mark the International Day Against Homophobia (IDAHO). Worldwide, IDAHO is being celebrated by events in more than 50 countries, from Nepal and Poland to Uganda and Venezuela.

CONTEXT	Question is being asked what has the aging recluse, Velupillai  2008-04-10T05:24:00  Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has achieved by killing the dissident Tamil leaders from Mayor Alfred Duraiyappah to Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle. Is he closer to his goal of creating a separate state of Tamil Eelam by these killings? Has he ushered in a rose garden with make milk and honey flowing on to the plates of the Tamils in the North and East? Has he managed to bring about peace and stability to the Tamil areas? Has he brought solace into Tamils home. At least has he stopped abducting the children of the Tamil fathers and mothers? Has he stopped deaths of his cadres, which have so far exceeded 20,000 Tamil youths, by his own admission? Has he managed to stop the destruction of the Tamil areas? In fact, what he has achieved? Somebody has to come up with an answer. Chief of the LTTE. Pottu Amman has spread his lethal tentacles all Sivasankaran-alias Pottu Amman, the so called demonic intelligence over the island and also internationally, killedl all those Tamils who opposed Prabhakaran and his deadly organization. This homicide department is involved daily in meticulously planning and killing Tamils who opposes Prabhakaran - the killer maniac and LTTE.  The LTTE Tamil rebel outfit, considers whoever who voices opposition So far LTTE has killed according to an unconfirmed account, more than 30,000 civilians, who include Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims. Even now the killing spree of the Tigers has not come to a halt. Killing fields of Prabhakaran extends all over the world. The killing spree continues unabated. In the beginning, Tamils in the Jaffna and Batticaloa experienced a different kind of emotions, when some one was killed by the LTTE. But suddenly it dawned on the Tamils when one of their own kith and kin children, are living with fear of loosing their children. The Tamil diaspora in United Kingdom, United States of America, Canada, Germany, France and other Western Countries are not aware of the problems the people in Vanni are undergoing. People in Vanni are her, why you don't send one of your children to Vanni to join the her how many children she has? She said she has three. Then I asked armed cadre of the Tamil Tigers. She immediately asked me why she should spare one of her child. I responded to her and said then only you can achieve the Tamil Eelam. The Lady was infuriated with my response about Tamil Eelam and of sparing one of her children to be the cannon fodder. Sorry I can't post all her comments here. This shows that Tamil diaspora who enjoy living in Western countries, who enjoy the freedom vital for their survival, but they get duped and begin to support the Tamil Tigers. It is baffling to know why?? Fernandopulle, the day before his death. We were at one stage talking Last week, I was having a long chat with Minister Jeyaraj about the Tamil diaspora giving money to the Tamil Tigers. Then the Minister said that, 'Any Tamil who donates money to LTTE war- Minister said. When the subject of Tamil Nadu leaders came up in our talk, the slain Minister said "If those Tamil Nadu leaders like Dr. Ramadoss, V.Gopalasamy really wanted to support Prabhakaran to establish a separate state in Sri Lanka, first let them carve out a separate state of Tamil Nadu, then let them interfere in the activities of Sri Lanka." He believed that many of these Tamil Nadu politicians including Pala Nedumaran are allegedly in the payroll of the Tamil Tigers. They are singing elegy for their supper. are now bent on disrupting the peace and harmony of the country and long ago, their usefulness to the society vanished. These spent-forces openly killing those whoever opposes them. As long as the Tamil diaspora in the Western countries continue pumping in moneys to the LTTE, the atrocities of the LTTE will continue.

CONTEXT	(euro18.1 billion) side deal for ABN's Chicago-based U.S. recommend it because its offer includes a US$24.5 billion subsidiary, LaSalle Bank Corp.  ABN has already agreed to sell LaSalle to Bank of America Corp. for $21 billion (US$15.5 billion), as part of its deal with Barclays, and BofA filed suit Friday in U.S. District Court in said Monday it had rejected RBS's "acquisition proposal for Facing a potentially multibillion dollar lawsuit from BofA, ABN LaSalle ... as a result of the uncertainty and execution risks." ABN's management helped cause the uncertainty and risks. It agreed to sell LaSalle to BofA without asking its shareholders for approval, in what was widely seen as a poison pill measure designed to frustrate the consortium and help the Barclays deal ABN's boards had "misunderstood" their duties in agreeing to sell LaSalle, the ruling by the Amsterdam Superior Court said, and were trying to present shareholders with a "done deal" that might not be in their best interests. It ordered the LaSalle sale But Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, says its contract to buy LaSalle is valid regardless of what Dutch courts say or what ABN shareholders do, setting the stage for a trans- Atlantic jurisdictional fight. Kempen & Co. analyst Ryan Palecek told Dow Jones Newswires that ABN's rejection of the RBS-lead bid for LaSalle could be a sign that ABN Amro is still trying to obstruct the consortium. BofA has five days to match any competing bid "for the same Under the terms of ABN Amro's agreement with Bank of America, businesses" of Chicago-based LaSalle. But since the RBS bid is conditional on the takeover of ABN, it wasn't clear whether its offer is really for the "same businesses." Some investors interpreted Fortis' statement -- that a LaSalle buy "would have led to a public offer" for ABN -- as a sign the consortium may give up. The banks declined further comment.

CONTEXT	 PREVIOUSLY ON "DIRTY SEXY MONEY": The last time we saw the Darlings, Karen was having an affair with her father's arch enemy Simon Elder. However, we learned by the end of the Christmas episode, this was a devious scheme concocted by Tripp, who vowed to destroy Elder. But was Karen, as a result, really falling for the techno-philanthropist billionaire? Meanwhile, Lisa lost her job at the gallery and Nick suggested they have another child. Fearing she was losing her husband to the Darlings, Lisa was enthusiastic about the idea. Nick's brother Brian lost his son and decided to leave church. Following careful deliberation, he accepted Tripp's proposal to join the family business, despite being a George. Fans of Glenn Fitzgerald swooned at the sight of Brian in a business suit. Juliet, who had just returned from her sister's honeymoon in the Seychelles, introduced her family to Kai, a young man she fell in love with while being on those "distant green islands." Kai is having a hard time adjusting to Juliet's lifestyle, especially being constantly surrounded by the paparazzi. He however quickly adjusts, especially after he is asked to replace a male model in Natalie Kimpton's new music video. The Governor, who appears to be a good friend of Simon Eldder, declines a request from Tripp Darling to interfere in the Fantini case and help him avoid the subpoena to testify, issued by his son Patrick, the Attourney General. Patrick may soon have a reason to withdraw his subpoena, though. Meanwhile, Nick and Brian work together to help Tripp. The patriarch asks Nick to make the subpoena go away expressing concern that Simon Elder's personal vendetta may undermine Nick's hard work on the hospital project. Jeremy helps Lisa begin her own business, an art dealership, in a premium location. She originally encounters problems due to her inexperience and lack of first-class clientèle. But is it a good idea to run a business with Jeremy? Lolita Davidovich joins "Dirty Sexy Money" as Flavia Carozzi as a potential romantic interest for Tripp. Also, Samaire Armstrong's character Juliet may be leaving the series . Or is she?

CONTEXT	 And yet they were sold as a relatively safe investment, even though the companies which sold them didn't have the assets to pay out on them. That's fraud. Warren Buffet calls derivatives "weapons of mass destruction", and they should be treated as such. Remember that banks and financial houses have hidden their derivatives exposure off the balance sheets. And almost no one understands derivatives: "Not only [world's richest man] Warren Buffett, but Bond King Bill Gross, our Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and the rest of America's leaders can't 'figure out'" the derivatives market. Indeed, the government actively helped to hide the derivatives mess since at least 2006. For example, according to Business Week:

CONTEXT	 Not having seen the British mini-series from which State of Play is adapted, I was not aware of the many twists and turns that I figured the tale was sure to have. Despite a final act botch-up involving the character of Robin Wright-Penn Macdonald mostly succeeds in making a no-fuss movie. More for adults - there is copious amounts of dialogue and the "thriller" elements are decidedly brief and un-flashy - it features good performances out of Ben Affleck as a scandalous senator and Russell Crowe as the journalist friend out to solve the story. Helen Mirren adds fire as Crowe's editor and Jason Bateman arrives in fourth gear as a sleazy PR agent. It is, however, Rachel McAdams that comes out best from the film and it's just a shame she doesn't have more to do because it was nice to reminded of her talent. State of Play isn't reinventing the wheel, but it does succeed in being a well-made drama/thriller that doesn't always use the easy options (doesn't always, but sometimes does). It wastes throwaway story-lines, that were obviously more prevalent in the British extended TV series, and the actors involved in them (that would be Wright-Penn and Jeff Daniels), but it provides enough fire to make for a rousing piece of movie entertainment.

In a testimony before New York's attorney general Andrew Cuomo in February, Lewis told prosecutors that he believed Paulson and Bernanke were instructing him to keep silent about deepening financial difficulties at Merrill, which BofA acquired in January. Lewis testified that the government wanted him to remain silent while the two sides negotiated government funding to help BofA absorb Merrill and its losses, the paper said, citing transcripts of the testimony. A representative of Cuomo questioned Lewis about his failure to disclose Merrill's fourth-quarter losses, which eventually totaled $15.84 billion, according to the paper.

CONTEXT	 Fwd: Malaysian Christians allowed to use the word "Allah" - or are they?  abu arnab <TheFoolOfAl...@gmail.com>   2008-01-15T12:57:03  Subject: Malaysian Christians allowed to use the word "Allah" - or are they? To: soc.religion.islam, From: "Robert Houghton" <rober ... @f2s.com> E6D391... ( http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/689F1DD4-8D56-45C6-9E99- .htm), Dec 31, reports that the Malaysian government has without explanation reversed a decision to ban a Malay-language Catholic newspaper, "The Herald", from using the word "Allah." Officials had previously forbidden this, stating that "Allah" can only be used to refer to the Muslim God. The Malaysian Muslim authorities do not seem to know their religion. It is perfectly clear from the Koran that Muhammad's God was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and thus the Jewish and Christian God. The Koran is explicit about this: "And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be in (a way) that is better, save with such of them as do wrong; and say: We believe in Allah is One, and unto Him we surrender." (29:46, Pickthal) (Note that the argument is only one way: Muslims are permitted to proselytize Christians, but not vice versa; thus Muslims can argue that Allah is God, but not Christians.) Muslims, as events in Malaysia show, often attempt to appropriate the word "Allah," forgetting that this is just the word for God in Arabic and was so used by Christian Arabs before Islam was heard of. The Muslim concept of God derives from Christianity and Judaism. Muslims are trying to deprive Christians of even the use of their language: the latest example of Islamic cultural totalitarianism. The Muslim threat to control the language of Christians (at least in print) is not, however, over: they have banned children's Sunday School "Meanwhile, in a separate development it has emerged that a church in the eastern state of Sabah is also suing Malaysian authorities for barring import of Christian literature from Indonesia containing the word "Allah". "Sabah Sidang Injil Borneo Church filed the case in Kuala Lumpur earlier this month after six titles for their Sunday school education for were banned." All this is reminiscent of the suppression of Christianity under Shariah law. Under that law Christian worship audible to Muslims is not permitted, the repair or building of churches is forbidden, mosques were regularly built to dwarf churches, and to this day in Egypt Copts have to endure their services being drowned out by the loud-speakers of neighbouring mosques. Letters from the internal security ministry said the books contained various words that were exclusive to Islam, including "Allah" (God), "Baitullah" (House of God), "Solat" (prayer) and "Kaabah" (The Sacred House).

Mr. Clinton believed the question had seemed sympathetic to Mr. Obama's stakes in the suit, Clinton campaign officials said. endorsed Mr. Obama, and their votes on Saturday could help him Nevadans are members of Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which has significantly against Mrs. Clinton. The suit was brought by the state teachers' union, which maintained working Saturday did not have. Some of this union's top officials have that the arrangement gave the hotel employees an advantage that others endorsed Mrs. Clinton. But her campaign has denied involvement in the suit, and when the television reporter suggested a connection between it and her supporters, the former president, stumping for her in Oakland, Calif., narrowed his eyes. As his aides looked on with concern, Mr. Clinton's voice took on an edge. "When you ask me that question, your position is that you think that the culinary workers' vote should be easier" than those of other Nevada workers, Mr. Clinton told the reporter, Mark Matthews of KGO-TV in Oakland. "If you want to take that position, get on the television and take it. Don't be accusatory with me." Mr. Clinton's temper has been an issue for him as long as he has been in public life. But it has played an unusual role during the current campaign, his face turning red in public nearly every week, often or not intentionally, into her race in sometimes distracting ways. Some Clinton advisers say the campaign is trying to rein him in somewhat, so that his outbursts become less of a factor to reporters, but his flashes of anger only seem to be growing. Last week, for instance, a clearly agitated Mr. Clinton told Dartmouth students that it was a "fairy tale" for Mr. Obama to contend that he had been consistently against the war in Iraq. And in December he said that But some advisers say a former president at times prone to outrage can draw attention to issues as no one else can. They say Mr. Clinton's "roll the dice" comment, made on the PBS television program "Charlie Rose," helped focus public and media attention on Mr. Obama's scarce experience relative to Mrs. Clinton's, a factor that her campaign saw as contributing to her victory in the New Hampshire primary. At the same time, Mr. Clinton was releasing steam that had built up within the campaign over news coverage. who has been an adviser to presidents of both parties, including Mr. Barack," said David R. Gergen, a Harvard professor of public service Clinton. "He is a bit like Mount Vesuvius: he'll just erupt, but then it's over, because the good thing about his temper is that he doesn't bear grudges."

Mr. Clinton has reflected on his temper over the years, perhaps most revealingly in his autobiography. At one point in it, he recalls a day in junior high school when he hit a boy who had been taunting him. It "I was a little disturbed by my anger, the currents of which would prove deeper and stronger in the years ahead," Mr. Clinton wrote.

DL makes an extremely good point which it that there has been a significant lack of posts about Mark Ruffalo on this blog. This is not my fault. 2006 has not been a good year for Mr. Ruffalo. Or should I say it has not been a good year for Ruffalo fans. Unless you live in New York you wouldn't have been able to catch his surprisingly good performance in Awake and Sing! at the Belasco Theater and then graciously stalk afterwards like I did . When I turned in my coverage of this show to my supervisors at my company, I called his perf "compulsively watchable". I was suprised to see this phrase make its way into a memo to the Proverbial Powers That Be. He lost the Tony to some pimply faced kid from History Boys I think. But, you know, its an honor just to be nominated. Other than that? SLOW on the Ruffalo front. Zodiac has been pushed to January 2007 (not a good sign). Steve Zaillian's All The King's Men will be released in a couple weeks but Ruffalo is in the trailer for about 0.75 seconds. He reteams with Lonergan for Margaret but I really thought the script was weak for this film. Anna Paquin needs to get a real job. And on top of all that Lonergan passed over Ruffalo for the juicy part of Mr. Aaron (going with Matt Damon instead) and casted the Ruff-Stuff as the goomba bus driver. Which I'm sure Ruffalo will execute with wall-leaning gusto. The Brass Wall will probably never happen. I am looking forward to the recently-announced, Joaquin Phoenix co-starring Reservation Road . Or as my roommate, Miriam, calls it "THE BEST MOVIE EVER!" Alas the project is still far off. And so, we wait with baited breath. We patiently twiddle respective thumbs and other body parts until Ruffalo decides to GRACE US WITH HIS PRESENCE! It's funny that this should get brought up now as I am commencing on a writing a short film tentatively titled: Mark Ruffalo Saved My Life . Eye-catching right? Sadly, Mark will not be in it as I don't know Mark Ruffalo and have only spoken to his agent a couple times and I doubt she'd remember me. But it will be cheeky and intense. Anyway... Thoughts? You guys like the title? Don't care? Great.

CONTEXT	 Last night the Farmboyz and I attended the Poi Dog Pondering concert at the Bowery Ballroom, the first time seen them since I had pretty much ignored them on some multi-act bill back in Florida a dozen or more years ago. Poi Dog's style is impossible to pigeonhole - they're a bizarre melange of blues, disco, house, and Hawaiian, with not a little Irish folk thrown in. Last night's 23-song set included much of their early hits like Complicated , but also leaned heavily on their just-released seventh studio album, 7 . The highlight of the show for me was their cover of Ten City's That's The Way Love Is , one of my favorite early house tracks. Poi Dog's current eight-piece ensemble has one of the highest levels of musicianship you'll likely experience live; I recommended catching them on the rest of this tour , which hits Philly, Baltimore, and Boston over the next three nights. After the show, we headed for Habibi , the gay Arab party which has moved around Manhattan for the last couple of years. We've always wanted to attend Habibi, so when we heard that this month's event would be at the Eagle, of all places, we couldn't resist. We walked into the lower level to see that they were finally using their recently-acquired cabaret license. The pool table was removed for dancing and with Arab techno blasting and Bollywood videos on the big screen - the place was jumping and packed.

"Nader and Gonzalez are the only candidates that truly put the environment at the forefront. Mr. Nader was instrumental in establishing the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the EPA. Nader/Gonzalez will not sell out to corporate interests. I can't believe that any real environmentalist would support anyone else." The Nader/Gonzalez campaign has completed its goal of achieving 45 state ballots, and will be a write-in choice in four other states.

When the news of her pay rise hit trade press, actresses across Hollywood asked themselves: "If Kyra can make so much money, why can't I?" Studios and networks often complain about rising production costs, but they have been nevertheless willing to pay top bucks to retain their most recognizable faces.

People clearly still want to cast her, but I just wish they'd cast her in something that's... well, that's not Georgia Rule , ya know? Alan J Pakula's Klute features everything that is so great about Fonda. Everything on down to how she pulls off that should-be iconic dress. And as an example of this sort of '70s thriller it ranks as one of the very finest. Fonda, however, is the key to everything and watching this just makes me pine.

CONTEXT	 Suelo lights the candle and stokes a fire in the stove, which is an old blackened tin, the kind that Christmas cookies might come in. It's hooked to a chain of soup cans segmented like a caterpillar and fitted to a hole in the rock. Soon smoke billows into the night and the cave is warm. I think of how John the Baptist survived on honey and locusts in the desert. Suelo, who keeps a copy of the Bible for bedtime reading, is satisfied with a few grasshoppers fried in his skillet. HE WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY. SUELO graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in anthropology, he thought about becoming a doctor, he held jobs, he had cash and a bank account. In 1987, after several years as an assistant lab technician in Colorado hospitals, he joined the Peace Corps and was posted to an Ecuadoran village high in the Andes. He was charged with monitoring the health of tribespeople in the area, teaching first aid and nutrition, and handing out medicine where needed; his proudest achievement was delivering three babies. The tribe had been getting richer for a decade, and during the two years he was there he watched as the villagers began to adopt the economics of modernity. They sold the food from their fields-quinoa, potatoes, corn, lentils-for cash, which they used to purchase things they didn't need, as Suelo describes it. They bought soda and white flour and refined sugar and noodles and big bags of MSG to flavor the starchy meals. They bought TVs. The more they spent, says Suelo, the more their health declined. He could measure the deterioration on his charts. "It looked," he says, "like money was impoverishing them." The experience was transformative, but Suelo needed another decade to fashion his response. He moved to Moab and worked at a women's shelter for five years. He wanted to help people, but getting paid for it seemed dishonest-how real was help that demanded recompense? The answer lay, in part, in the Christianity of his childhood. In Suelo's nascent philosophy, following Jesus meant adopting the hard life prescribed in the Sermon on the Mount. "Giving up possessions, living beyond credit and debt," Suelo explains on his blog, "freely giving and freely taking, forgiving all debts, owing nobody a thing, living and walking without guilt . . . grudge [or] judgment." If grace was the goal, Suelo told himself, then it had to be grace in the classical sense, from the Latin gratia, meaning favor-and also, free. The morning ritual is simple and slow: a cup of sharp tea brewed from the needles of piñon and juniper trees, a swim in the cold emerald water where the creek pools in the red rock. Then, two naked cavemen lounging under the Utah sun. Around noon, we forage along the banks and under the cliffs, looking for the stuff of a stir-fry dinner. We find mustard plants among the rocks, the raw leaves as satisfying as cauliflower, and down in the cool of the creek-where Suelo gets his water and takes his baths (no soap for him) -we cull watercress in heads as big as supermarket lettuce, and on the bank we spot a lode of wild onions, with bulbs that pop clean from the soil. In leaner times, Suelo's gatherings include ants, grubs, termites, lizards, and roadkill. He recently found a deer, freshly run over, and carved it up and boiled it. "The best venison of my life," he says. I tell him that living without money seems difficult. What about starvation? He's never gone without a meal (friends in Moab sometimes feed him). What about getting deadly ill? It happened once, after eating a cactus he misidentified-he vomited, fell into a delirium, thought he was dying, even wrote a note for those who would find his corpse. But he got better. That it's hard is exactly the point, he says. "Hardship is a good thing. We need the challenge. Our bodies need it. Our immune systems need it. My hardships are simple, right at hand-they're manageable." When I tell him about my rent back in New York-$2,400 a month-he shakes his head. What's left unsaid is that I'm here writing about him to make money, for a magazine that depends for its survival on the advertising revenue of conspicuous consumption. As he prepares a cooking fire, Suelo tells me that years ago he had a neighbor in the canyon, an alcoholic who lived in a cave bigger than his. The old man would pan for gold in the stream and net enough cash each month to buy the beer that kept him drunk. Suelo considers the riches of our own forage. "What if we saw gold for what it is?" he says meditatively. "Gold is pretty but virtually useless. Somebody decided it has worth, and everybody accepted this decision. The natives in the Americas thought Europeans were insane because of their lust for such a useless yellow substance." He sautés the watercress, mustard leaves, and wild onions, mixing in fresh almonds he picked from a friend's orchard and ghee made from Dumpster-dived butter, and we eat out of his soot-caked pans. From the perch on the cliff, the life of the sadhu seems reasonable. But I don't want to live in a cave. I like indoor plumbing (Suelo squats). I like electricity. Still, there's an obvious beauty in the simplicity of subsistence. It's an un-American notion these days. We don't revere our ascetics, and we dismiss the idea that money could be some kind of consensual delusion. For most of us, it's as real as the next house payment. Suelo doesn't take public assistance or use food stamps, but he does survive in part on our reality, the discarded surfeit of the money system that he denounces-a system, as it happens, that recently looked like it was headed for the cliff.

Since 9/11, now social activist groups are relegated to the pile of terrorists. If you ask Americans who get their news in snippets from TV or radio about all this spying by the FBI, the Pentagon and the NSA or NASA as the president calls it, they are likely to respond by saying that they don't associate with those activist nutcases so they don't care if civil rights have been violated by the administration. They'd rather give up their civil rights than be violated by "terrorists". They move to gated communities and buy guns for protection. Americans are some of the biggest scaredy cats in the world. Me, I'd rather that the government mind its own business and stay out of our lives. I'll take my chances rather than live in a gated community learning how to shoot a gun. Activism is what made our country a pretty good place to live. We can breathe better, eat safer foods, be free from most epidemics and look forward to social security checks in our old age because of social activism.

Words to live by. 5) Housing - Berkshire has exposure to the mortgage and housing market by virtue of its ownership of Clayton Homes, the largest company in the prefab home market.

The comedian will replace Bob Barker as the new host of The Price Is Right. The Cleveland native confirmed his new gig as the host of the CBS game show during a taping of the The Late Show with David Letterman, which is set to air Monday. Barker retired last month after 35 years of hosting the daytime sensation, drawing a slew of replacement contenders including Rosie O'Donnell, Ian Ziering, George Hamilton and Mario Lopez. Carey, who will also be host of a new CBS prime-time game show, The Power of 10, told Letterman that he only learned that the deal had been done a few minutes before appearing on stage. Yeah, I am not at all in agreement on this decision. My pick was for George Hamilton to get the job. I just know that watching The Price is Right with Drew Carey as the host will be about as exciting as watching The Family Feud with any of the many lame-ass hosts who followed Richard Dawson as host. This whole matter can be summed up in two words: Poop Sandwich .

Williams, a three-time Pro Bowler, missed the final two regular-season games with ankle and hip ailments. "Everything feels fine, and I'm ready to rock and roll,'' Williams said. "It's the playoffs." The Chargers hope for a payoff after Williams sat out the past two weeks. Coach Norv Turner noticed a invigorated Williams during Wednesday's workout. Young and running backs LenDale White and Chris Brown. That's why Williams' health is so critical. It's imperative that the Chargers win defensively on running downs, so they can unleash their impressive pass rush. "I can put my ears back,'' Merriman said. "And I would appreciate that.'' Williams' play is noticed by both clubs. Titans center Kevin Mawae will lock quickness and leverage, so I think it's a good matchup for both of us." Williams, a 10-year pro, had his hands full with Mawae in the Jets-Chargers playoff game after the 2004 season; Mawae, now in his 14th year, was with the Jets. "I guess it will be two old vets fighting, just out there having fun," Williams said. "But you know it is going to be a battle." The Chargers' run defense looked different the past two weeks, with Williams

CONTEXT	 MTV announced this week that they have begun the search for the new undiscovered Broadway star to take on the role of Elle Woods in Legally Blonde: The Musical on Broadway. Hosted by Haylie Duff , MTV will air a new competitive reality TV series where Broadway hopefuls will compete for the role that will be left vacant by the original Elle Woods actress Laura Bell Bundy . Here is a cute photo of Haylie and Laura Bell at the press announcement event this week and the full text of the press release for the new show: The first cable network to televise a musical in its entirety, MTV will follow the success of its "Legally Blonde The Musical" special by again partnering with the musical team for the reality competition series "Legally Blonde The Musical: The Search For Elle Woods," premiering Monday, June 2nd at 10p.m. ET/PT. Actress Haylie Duff ("7th Heaven," Hairspray on Broadway and Napoleon Dynamite) stars in and executive produces alongside Reveille, the eight-episode series which will provide an authentic first-hand look at what it takes to star in a Broadway musical. Viewers will follow 10 "triple-threat" hopefuls as they vie for the ultimate shot at stardom: the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to star on Broadway at the Palace Theatre and replace the Tony Award nominated Laura Bell Bundy in the leading role of "Elle Woods" in Legally Blonde The Musical, which is based on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Picture's (MGM) hit film "Legally Blonde." Week-to-week a nation of fans will watch the drama unfold as these talented young women embark on a grueling and high-stakes season-long audition. The series will provide a genuine glimpse into just how difficult it can be to headline a musical as the contestants receive direction from and ace challenges provided by the very creative team involved with Legally Blonde The Musical. On hand to show the ladies just what it takes to succeed in the show will be the musical's director and Tony Award winning choreographer Jerry Mitchell, who will serve as the final word on who will star nightly on his stage; associate director Marc Bruni; associate choreographer Denis Jones; and cast members including Laura Bell Bundy the original, Tony Award Nominated "Elle Woods" of Broadway, Nikki Snelson (the original "Brooke Wyndham"), Orfeh ("Paulette") and Richard H. Blake ("Warner Huntington III"). As they progress, the ladies will have to learn the musical's dance routines and songs all while giving their all in around-the-clock rehearsals and workshops. As they navigate the obstacles involved with getting their theater dreams off the ground, they will learn to deal with being both competitors and roommates as they live together in a New York City loft. An emerging Broadway actress in her own right, Duff will be on-hand with renowned theater vocal coach Seth Rudetsky to provide some much-needed guidance as the contestants face critiques from a panel of expert judges filled with some of the theater industry's most respected names. Serving as judges for the series in which they will jumpstart one lucky young woman's theater career are legendary casting director Bernard Telsey; Legally Blonde The Musical's Tony Award nominated book writer Heather Hach; and Original Broadway cast member of Legally Blonde The Musical Paul Canaan. This J-Team made up of judges and Jerry Mitchell – not America – will decide who the next "Elle Woods" will be. Beginning May 5, MTV.com will add to the fun by going platinum blonde with exclusive show content and extras. Viewers will be able to log onto LegallyBlonde.MTV.com to see cast profiles, photos, audition reels and performances; get info on Haylie Duff and the series judges; watch full episodes and the series trailer; and check-out deleted show scenes and episodic flipbooks exclusive to MTV.com. As much as I hate the thought of Laura Bell Bundy leaving the show (she is, after all, one of the best new Broadway actresses of our time, you know) I have to agree that this competitive reality TV show to cast the part is pretty brills. I know I'll be watching each week as hopefuls backstab and try to tear each other apart engage in friendly competition in order to win a chance to star on Broadway. Maybe it'll be like Making the Band 4 , but with real talent. Sounds like fun. [ Source ]

I just wish they both had won, as they certainly earned it. If Jake gets nominated again for something, I'll want him to win, but I'm not so concerned about awards. I'm sure he thinks it would be nice, sort of an official acknowledgment of his ability, but I doubt it keeps him awake at night. As long as he always focuses on the work, he'll have us, his loyal Gyllenhaalics, with him through his career.

CONTEXT	 In 2002, a wise-cracking, 'good-natured', 'reflexively smart-alec' Jake Gyllenhaal ('Maybe it's because he's 21') was interviewed in Toronto by the San Francisco Chronicle about Moonlight Mile and they wanted to know if he is indeed 'the thinking woman's younger man': "Yes, very smart women are throwing themselves at me in a very smart way,... Let's just say the position offers itself up some very nice opportunities, euphemistically put. But then, the smart woman will be able to interpret that." But after reflection: "If it means I can find a lovely, lovely woman to spend my life with, and she has a good mind, then it sounds good." Jake doesn't seem so happy with comparisons between his own role in Moonlight Mile and the young Dustin Hoffman's in The Graduate, although his high regard and respect for Dustin is pretty clear: 'Hoffman's also in the room, being interviewed at another table. Gyllenhaal, who beams in Hoffman's presence, shouts across the room to his co-star: "She says I remind her of you!" "You're taller, you're better-looking, and when I played your character, I was 10 years older," Hoffman shoots back, without missing a beat.' And it was with the encouragement of Dustin, that Jake took to the boards of the West End. A wonderful article , in the New York Times Magazine, from September 2003 when Jake had just finished filming The Day After Tomorrow, really brings this young, playful and thoughtful Jake to life. This Jake does everything fom complain about the size of his big head (24 inches), eat meatballs with a toothpick, dance around Ikea to Walking on Sunshine, to collapsing in a box of red rubber balls - 'I'm floating in a pan of giant cranberries'. Jake chose the location of the interview (Ikea at Burbank) because: ''I like Ikea because it feels like the potential of a home,' says Gyllenhaal, who remains undaunted by the actor's itinerant life. 'I've just been roaming the land. I live in a storage bin and eat at Ikea.''

CONTEXT	 OY! I feel like I've been away for a million years. Not only did my long weekend in Las Vegas feel like a really long vacation (with way too much partying) but the fact that I haven't written a proper blog post since Friday makes me feel a little out of sorts. Things return to normal today and there is a lot of stuff to catch up on ... I must admit, tho, it was a bit difficult to get back into the swing of things this morning. Yesterday's 9/11 post was my 1,800th post on Pink is the new Blog ... which I think is pretty interesting. So okay ... let's get to it. As much as I'm sure people are pretty much over the MTV VMA s and the unfortunate Britney Spears debacle, there are a few more things I'd like to touch on before I close the book on the 2007 VMA s altogether. Last night was the first time I got to watch the VMA s on TV ... even tho MTV swore they would only air this year's awards ONE TIME ONLY, they ended up re-airing the entire show last night calling it a "remix" by interjecting celebrity commentary thruout the show. Interestingly, in this "remix" version all of Britney 's performance was left intact (I was afraid they were going to omit it entirely, like they did back in 1991 when Paula Abdul gave an AWFUL performance [which I recall was also blamed on "the outfit"] of the song Vibeology on that year's VMA s which was deleted from all future airings afterwards ... which, thanks to You Tube , can be seen HERE ) but the portion of Sarah Silverman 's routine where she joked about Britney 's kids, vagina and Paris Hilton was COMPLETELY omitted. Poop sandwich, I say. Overall, tho, I really liked the show ... and apparently a lot of the audience did as well since viewership was up 23% this year. Personally, I think the hype about Britney 's comeback performance helped get the viewership up. Kanye West is saying that MTV exploited Britney just to get ratings, claiming that they "knew" she wasn't ready to perform and "made" her do it . Total bollocks! No one makes Britney Spears do a damn thing ... good or bad (and mostly bad) she makes all her own decisions now and everyone else be damned. I love her, I still really do, but she is to blame for how she looked ( pissing off Ken Paves , who was styling her hair, right before show time was a huge mistake ) and how her performance came out (in rehearsals, she looked animated ... on the big stage she looked bored ... or like she was on something). She is the one who decides whether or not she is going to wear underwear ... Photo Credit: WENN Nobody puts Ashlee Simpson in the corner . Jayden James Federline Spears is 1, Jennifer Hudson is 26, Paul Walker is 34 and Ben Folds is 41 years old today. Click HERE to see who else is celebrating a birthday today. OH MY ! Life is slowing getting back to normal ... I swear, hanging out in Las Vegas for any amount of time shaves years off your life. I just don't understand 1.) how anyone gets anything accomplished in that city and 2.) how people don't just drop dead from all the partying/drinking/craziness. That said, David and I had an amazing weekend together. I think I'm getting back into the swing of things again ... I'm meeting up with Kirsten, Darion and Paul for dinner on the Westside tonight so that should be fun. I am having a hard time believing the temps around here ... it's still warm in the day but the nights are cooler ... to the point of needing a hoody. LV was so hot that it was a nice change of pace once I got home ... but I am a wee bit bummed that summer has, indeed, made its exit this year :( Ah well ... time marches on. I hope y'all have a great day ... I am out.

CONTEXT	 El-Banna's friend Bisher al-Rawi, an Iraqi living in Britain, was helping MI5 keep tabs on London's Muslim community. At the time, Abu Qatada was in hiding to avoid arrest under Britain's anti-terrorism laws, and al-Rawi relayed messages between MI5 and the cleric. El-Banna, meanwhile, sometimes drove Abu Qatada's wife and children to the imam's hideout as a favor to al-Rawi, el-Banna's lawyers said. Al-Rawi also recruited el-Banna on the trip that ended with their arrest in Africa. El-Banna planned to manage a Gambian peanut oil plant, and the MI5 officer assured him he could travel. But El-Banna and al-Rawi were detained at Gatwick Airport the next day. According to an MI5 memo written that day -- Nov. 1, 2002 -- "some form of homemade electronic device" found in al- Al-Rawi was released from Guantanamo in April.

Moreover, on Sunday, one day after the declaration of the state of emergency, 25 militants were freed in exchange for 213 soldiers who were captured in the tribal rea of South Waziristan in August.

CONTEXT	 More people need to stand up to these bullies... Organizers of last summer's boycott of the Toronto International Film Festival who are now turning their sights to a student film festival in Tel Aviv have inadvertently raised the ire of two of Hollywood's biggest stars, director James Cameron and actress Jane Fonda. In a draft letter addressed to international film schools participating in this year's Tel Aviv University student film festival, Toronto-area filmmaker Kathy Wazana and York University film professor John Greyson urge professors and department heads to boycott the festival, saying the Israeli government "uses cultural events such as this one to whitewash their tarnished international image." The letter, circulated several weeks ago by Ms. Wazana to fellow filmmakers, academics and friends she expected would be sympathetic to the boycott call, listed Mr. Cameron and Ms. Fonda as two "example" signatories -- individuals who might help the boycott gain a higher profile. However, the group's efforts took an unusual turn when Mr. Cameron and Ms. Fonda learned their names were included in the draft letter. Their names were not on the final letter later sent to film schools. "Ms. Fonda did not know such a letter existed and, of course, did not sign anything and does not agree with its contents," Pat Kingsley, Ms. Fonda's publicist, told the National Post yesterday. "I believe ... one of the two drafters of the letter added her name and James Cameron as a joke. Contents of this letter certainly do not represent Jane Fonda's thinking."

CONTEXT	 That appears to be the Weinstein's personal matra, doesn't it? Everything about them seems to be "coming soon". I checked out their official website today and thought I'd see what they had up about the new film by Stephen Daldry ( Billy Elliot and The Hours ) starring Ralph Fiennes and Kate Winslet and was, of course, greeted by this: For a movie that is out in seven weeks and two days, the fact that they don't even have a trailer (or poster, for that matter) is both worrying and typical. Word on the Oscar blogosphere is that The Reader is far from being complete and that the Weinsteins are just being greedy and now that their partnership with MGM has come to an end I wonder how they are ever going to market this movie. They do realise, don't they, that in order to get people to see your film you must release a poster and a trailer and actually market it. Or are they taking cues from the Australian film industry?

MY friend Jayaprakash Tissainayagam is in detention. A senior journalist and Tamil, he was arrested on March 7 by the Terrorism Investigations Department (TID) and he does not know why he is being detained  Lanka news <rupasi...@gmail.com>   2008-04-04T16:00:00  J.S. Tissainayagam: Terror Suspect or Prisoner of Conscience? MY friend Jayaprakash Tissainayagam is in detention. A senior journalist and Tamil, he was arrested on March 7 by the Terrorism Investigations Department (TID) and he does not know why he is being detained. Yesterday, the supreme court took up a fundamental rights In terms of the definition of the phrase 'prisoner of conscience', I believe Tissa, as he is known to his friends, qualifies to be one. According to Amnesty International, the term refers to anyone violence. Tissa never condoned terrorism or separatism. Neither do his writings exhort Tamils to take to violence. He only spoke and wrote with the intention of making the Tamils equal citizens of this country. The issue at stake is not only Tissa's detention but also the hallowed concept of freedom of expression, which is an essential ingredient in a vibrant democracy. If ours is a true democracy, anyone should be able to say that Tamil people have the right to self determination. Of course, I agree promoting violence to achieve this end is unlawful and should be dealt with legally in accordance with the law. A budding intellectual, Tissa often had a stimulating counterpoint. Whenever I met him, I made sure that I spent some time with him over a cup of tea, so that I could learn something from him. Our discussions varied from constitutional matters and crises in politics to the media scene and movies. A human rights activist for the past two decades, Tissa, through his writing, had also highlighted the plight of the Sinhala youth, most of whom were JVP sympathisers, when they were being hounded by government- backed goon squads in the late 1980s. At the time of his arrest, he was running a news website funded by a German non-governmental organisation, FLICT (Facilitating Local Initiative for Conflict Transformation), which seeks to strengthen the capacity of Sri Lankan civil society to play a more effective and influential role in contributing towards a lasting and positive peace. I was a regular visitor to the website and impressed by its content and presentations. His office was situated in Colombo's Tamil- dominated Jampettah Street, an area that is regularly subjected to cordon-and-search operation by the security forces. The building that houses Tissa's office is owned by a Tamil nationalist writer who runs a printing press in the same building. The police first came for the printing press owner and took him to the TID headquarters on the basis that the press was being used for the propaganda work of the LTTE, which, strangely, is not a banned group Britain and the United States. Tissa went to TID to inquire about the detention of the printing press owner but ended up being a detainee himself. When I heard that he was arrested by the TID, about which many Sri Lankans know very little, the question that flashed across my mind was whether he was being tortured. practice has long been abandoned. But I strongly believe that cops are Lanka has been a signatory to the torture convention, the abominable cops, for whom international treaties make little or no sense. So each time, I spoke to Tissa's wife who is allowed to see him twice a week or so, I wanted to know whether he was being treated well. She speaks to him in the presence of a police officer and therefore she says he is not free to talk. But modern torture techniques like waterboarding won't show any external wounds. We were worried. A mutual friend told me, "We should be relieved that Tissa was not picked up by the goons who come in the much-feared white van." A few years ago, another famous journalist, Dharmalingam Sivaram, a Tamil, was abducted by a gang as soon as he left a pub just opposite a police station in Colombo. His body with gun shot injuries was found the following day in the high security zone near the parliamentary Yes, Tissa should count himself lucky for not ending up like Sivaram. But why he is being detained is the question, to which his wife, parents and friends try to find an answer. With emergency laws in force, friends and lawyers can do very little. On the one hand, we admit that the police, which were facing the daunting task of eliminating terrorism from this country, have every right to question him. On the other, we know there are more bad cops than good cops in the police.  2008-04-05T02:11:00  Who is talking about this Tissainayagam? As far as many Tamils concerned, this Tissainayagam is an unknown.

CONTEXT	 Gorgeous blue-green eyes, long lashes, disapproving manner, 55-60, male? You could be Jake Gyllenhaal's dad and the role is up for grabs . 'Casting forces for filmmaker Ed Zwick have been talking to candidates to play the father of Jake Gyllenhaal in Zwick’s “Love and Other Drugs” film also starring Anne Hathaway. The ideal actor should be between 55 and 60 years old and it couldn’t hurt if he has gorgeous blue-green eyes with long lashes like Jake’s. But anyway, the character is a doctor who disapproves of his son’s career as a pharmaceutical sales guy. Also being cast for the flick, which rolls in September, are his younger brother and mom.' The younger brother and mother don't get much of a look in here, but, presumably, you'll want to keep your lashes long for these roles as well. Talking of film fathers, one who looked to me like a good match as a dad for a young Jake was Dennis Quaid in The Day After Tomorrow. "We had Dennis in mind because he is strong, smart, likable, fatherly and tough," [Producer Mark] Gordon says. As for Gyllenhaal, last seen with Dustin Hoffman in Moonlight Mile, "you could believe Jake is Dennis' son, and not just physically. Together, they are charming, funny and warm." For me, it was the dimples... Another film producer, Frank Marshall , has been talking about his future projects including the future Lance Armstrong biopic: 'Despite the various casting rumors, Marshall says an upcoming unknown actor is looking likely to take the role of the famed cyclist as the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and Matt Damon are too old - “The book really only takes Lance up to the first tour, so he’s only 21.”' This surprises me because it suggests that, even back in 2006, when Jake was out cycling with Lance on what seemed like every Summer Sunday, he would have been too old. It also makes me think there'll be a Part 2. Proof It was wonderful to see the Brokeback Mountain videos from Venice and, with extra thanks to Monica, we can now see the photocall from Proof's showing at the same festival. Proof may have been overshadowed by Brokeback but if you want to see Jake strike a pose then look no further. And finally... As an update to yesterday's post, surprisingly and disappointingly, and despite her presence in the UK of late, Maggie Gyllenhaal wasn't at the Edinburgh Film Festival last night. Sam Mendes and John Krasinski (and Sean Connery) were . We (and Sam) already know John Krasinski .  2009-06-18T20:53:00   Anonymous  Thanks for the Proof photocall video, that's another one I hadn't seen. Jake sure seemed in a good mood that day, I wish we could ear what the photographers told him to make him laugh so much. Good news about the Lance Armstrong biopic. It always sounded to me more like a made for TV movie more than a movie for the cinema and I don't see why Jake would want to do this. I know he admires Lance but still... He could do a lot more interesting projects. Love the TDAT cast pictures. Jake looked so good while promoting this movie. I love watching interviews he did during that time, you could feel he had fun making that movie and promoting it. And he looked hot. Did I already say that? :D Olympia Thought I'd share this: All of the honorees from film and television were present, with actors from their projects presenting them. Ang Lee ("Brokeback Mountain") was introduced by the quiet, softspoken Heath Ledger and the charming and gregarious Jake Gyllenhaal. They talked about what an honor and a privilege working on the film had been and how Ang's direction helped them grow as actors. When Heath and Jake introduced him, they both started to tear up and gave the director hugs when he reached the stage. The soft-spoken director took a moment, looked back at them with a smile, turned to the audience and said, "I don't know, guys. That felt kind of gay to me." BBM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2VbJFsIM8Y Anne Hathaway briefly talks about the movie with Jake before she's interrupted by the host who confused Jake with Joaquin Phoenix.d'oh! oh i'm so glad to hear Jake is not considered for Lance Armstrong biopic.i really hope he drops from Joe Namath thing too.it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere anyway.  2009-06-18T21:20:00  OMG Fan! That was so touching but also so funny! I wish we could see this somewhere, it must have been an incredible moment for Ang and the boys and I can just imagine them bursting out laughing at Ang's comment. :D I can see it in my mind so clearly... Ang is such a classy guy and it was always special anytime Jake and Heath presented something together. *sigh* I miss Heath... Hi there everyone! Hey Flower! I love Jake here - he's so animated :D I hope you have a good evening too! Hi Olympia! Jake looked GREAT during those promoting TDAT days - yep, HOT. You did say that, I'll say it too :D Fan - that is Fabulous! Thank you so, so much for that. I'd not seen it before and I love it and it makes me teary too. I have a BBM post on the way and I will love to add this. Lovely. Thanks :D Anon - love to have a name for you as you are GREAT! Thanks for that link - it's so wonderful that Anne is talking about this. I'm not so bothered by the Joe Namath thing either - the role with Anne sounds much better and more accessible to all of us. You are definitely due a hands post as thanks for this :D ok there you go, i got me a name!  2009-06-18T21:42:00  i thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool ;] Waves to Fan :) Yeay, Gretchen! Welcome! It's always special when an Anon picks a name and that is a cool name. Now I have a name to dedicate the hand post to :D Thank you!  2009-06-18T21:47:00   Uli  Wow, thanks Anon 21:05! Thanks for the link to the interview with Anne!!! So, it seems it is final and they are doing that movie together! I am excited!!!! And thank you, Fan, for the cute story about Ang, Heath and Jake... :) Hm, Olympia... You were wondering what the photographers told Jake to make them laugh... I hate to say it, but to me it sounded like they just told them to laugh - and he did... To me it looked a bit odd and I got the feeling that his laugh was not genuine... This feeling spoils pics of laughing Jake at such events a bit for me... But I could definitely be wrong about this. I would love to be wrong... But I got a strange impression... :( What a pity that Maggie (and so also Jake, I guess) didn't go to Edinburgh... I loved the idea of Jake in Edinburgh! Such a wonderful city!!! Hugs to everyone!!! Posting at the same time, Uli :D It's so exciting about Jake and Ane - and I also get the feeling that the whole project will be quick! Jake is so good in these photocall situations. He's like a model, he gives what they want. I don't get that impression you get. I see someone overawed but still loving it - that festival must have been amazing for Jake and Heath. A real pity about Maggie in Edinburgh - that's a fine city and I'd love to see her there. Wow...such great stuff here today my head is spinning! Extra gorgeous pics today WDW - (but then again they usually are gorgeous aren't they)?! I remember hearing about the DGAs that year but never being able to find a video of it - does anyone know if one exists? The photocall vid from that time has been around for a while but not the actual awards presentation as far as I know - man I wish we could get our hands on that! Can't wait for another BMM post, WDW, you know how much I love those (hence my name)!! Oh...and a hands post...well I voted for fingers so at least my requested part will be a part of the hand post...LOL! I may be the only one here that really, really, really wants Jake to do the Joe Namath project...LOL!! I just think he would be perfect at it and it would be really fun to see him do the things Joe Namath did (which were sometimes wild)! Oh, now that I think of it, there could be a lot of people here not from the states and don't even realize the "character" Jake would get to portray when playing this guy. (Or if from the states old enough to know a lot about this guy). Trust me, it would be fun to watch Jake as Joe! I would never want him to do something like this over something like Brothers (can't freaking wait) or the one he is doing with Anne or one where he can sing but in addition to these...yeah...this would be a GREAT role for Jake! He said he was definitely doing it but, boy, his dance card seems very full these days. Time will tell I guess! As for photocalls and the like, I think you worded it well here WDW. He really is like a model and all the PR related stuff these people are asked to do is going to be a bit "staged" no matter how you slice it. Some of them seem to at least try to have fun with it and really can work the room (and camera) and this for sure is Jake! I wish Heath was more comfortable in these situations - I don't think he realized how loved and adored he really was when he was in the middle of all the PR craziness (if he did he would have probably really freaked out with nervousness)! For someone that didn't enjoy it he still somehow came off so charming and beautiful anyway. Okay, I'm making myself want to cry so I'll sign off now. (Sorry that this is the longest comment in history). BBMISwear xoxo *rubs hands for "hands" post* imdb still doesn't have it listed on Jake's page, or Jake on the film's page.Anne is there though.as (rumored). this will be the 4th time Jake will play a real person, in a film based on that person's book.October Sky,Jarhead,Zodiac and this. i'll be very glad once that Joe Namath project disappears from his page.now i don't know anything about Joe Namath but i saw somewhere someone calling him "a sexist pig" and there were quite a few who agreed.i was like "omg Jake no!" and now i always remember that whenever i see that name. :/ Hey there BBMISwear :-) It'll be a pleasure to do a BBM post - I usually save them for Sundays, for some reason. Maybe as that's often a quiet day. I remember how you love the fingers! I think some of my feelings about/against the Namath role are cultural - this is a world away from the kind of film UK/European audiences would see. We know so little about this character. But I do take your word for it - and I do get the impression Jake would enjoy it. Unfortunately, I also think that such a film would get a tiny opening here. I'm intrigued by what may happen with this one. As for Love and Other Drugs - this will be great! I love your long post :D It's always a pleasure to think on Jake past and present. Looking at him here in Venice - Jake knows what to do :) That was a wonderful comment - thanks so mmkuch, BBMISwear :-) Hi Gretchen! INteresting that the film is posted as rumoured on Anne's and not a hint on Jake's, and yet Damn Yankees went up in a flash although no further news on that one. I know nothing about Namath and so it leaves me with little feelings for the film one way or the other. If Jake would enjoy doing it, and he wants to do it, then that's great. I'd just fear it wouldn't reach the screens within a thousand miles of here. Thanks for posting again!

I did just want to add that Joe Namath was not the type of guy that you'd want as a boyfriend or anything...LOL! The reason I think it would be fun to watch Jake play this character is because the guy is exactly that...such a character! He was definitely a loud, flashy, full of himself jock that drank too much and was a womanizer (I personally wouldn't mind seeing scenes of Jake drunk as a skunk)! He wore crazy 70's clothes and did cheesy commercials. Again...I think it would be FUN to watch Jake do all these things...and he would certainly have fun doing it! For anyone not bored by Joe Namath yet then check out this 1 minute commercial that was pretty famous back in the day in the states. This scene will definitely be in the movie if it's ever made...LOL! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM59nSkjEWU (Sorry that I don't know how to embed it right into the post...gotta do the old fashion copy and past thing)! Anyway, I do understand what you're saying WDW about a movie like this would be more for us fans in the states and not a big international thing. Hey, another excuse to come and visit...hee hee! :-)  2009-06-19T02:57:00   JoeAnn  I've liked the idea of a Joe Namath movie too. If well written, with an eye toward capturing the zeitgeist of the day, it could be a stand-out of Jake's career. And, hello! locker-room scenes!  2009-06-19T03:26:00   Monica  This post has been removed by the author.  2009-06-19T03:34:00  I am kind of curious about the Joe Namath movie...  2009-06-19T06:58:00  But I am also horrified by the thought of how Jake will look in the movie - all 70ies style to the extreme... Probably with a pornstache?? :D :D :D But yeah, people over here in Europe might not care about the movie too much because they will probably have no idea who Joe Namath was... So, as much as I wish that Jake would stay our little secret for a little longer (but maybe that ship has sailed anyway... :D :-/) I hope his name will be big enough by the time the J.N. movie comes out that it will find a distributor here anyway... I understand what you (WDW and BBMISwear) are saying about Jake giving the photographers what they want (he demonstrated that himself in some interview) and that it's always going to be a bit staged. It's part of his job and he is doing it so good. And I don't have a problem when the posing is about smiles or smouldering looks. But somehow I had hoped that those pics of Jake bursting out laughing in these situations were genuine and caused by somebody saying something really funny and not acted as well... I hope I will be able not to think about this when I see those kinds of pics in the future - or I just pretend that this photocall was an exception... Sorry to sound a bit negative about this... :-/ Morning Monica :D I think we're definitely due a year full of Jake movies! Hey BBMISwear :-) Ooh that definitely sounds more like it - I get sidetracked by the sport side of it but Namath does sound quite a character and it would be fun to see Jake act that way. Thanks for the vid link... :D Morning Uli :D I am so desperate to see Jake on a red carpet again I could pop! I'm very glad it's Friday too.  2009-06-19T11:44:00  I'm glad some of you liked the Joe Namath info...I didn't want to sound over the top about it but it did dawn on me that not everyone knows what this guy is all about! And OMG I didn't even think of the locker room scenes! Good point JoeAnn!! I guess we'll see if this movie will ever happen...along with all the other movies his name has been associated with. Thankfully at least one sounds confirmed (well, pretty much confirmed based on what Anne said). And, Uli, I understand what you're saying and I think it is a combination of staged and natural smiles and laughter during these PR scenarios. I think sometimes the photographers will yell out anything to get a good shot which may cause the person being photographed to pose for them but it also gets them laughing - and then it becomes a real laugh! Think about the BBM Venice photocall...the photographers were trying to tell Jake and Heath to stand together at one point but Anne was in the middle. This caused Jake to look at Heath and Anne and do the hand motion of putting his hands together and they all laughed - great pictures came from that (post that picture WDW - LOL)!! The photographers started it but that was pure Jake being Jake! Maybe we can think of times like that the next time something looks staged! :-) I have some first hand experience with this pertaining to musicians but won't go into it now...I've rambled on long enough! BBISwear, to post links: HTML links twitter: spotted: jake gyllenhaal and owen wilson in georgetown. we will soon find out if my sis D (helpful, right?) was able to track them down xoxo Let's start a campaign: Don't leave home without your camera! Hi WDW, I look forward to the BBM post! And a hands post! I agree with Uli, I think the Proof photocall laughter was mostly faked, but that didn't mean he wasn't enjoying himself. I think its irrelevant to him and the business he's in, so out of my respect for Jake, it'll be irrelevant to me. Though if it were anyone else it would matter more - a small but distinct sign of society's corruption. Re the Joe N thing, previously I did not really care either way, I thought its unlikely in the extreme to be a hit: but the fact that he was sexist? Oh no. No way. Not even in fun, not anymore, I'm just too old and too bored of unremarked sexism. It does too much damage.  2009-06-19T20:14:00  At least if Jake does a bio-pic I want him to do someone interesting.

CONTEXT	 The United States, Britain, France and Germany are expected to quickly recognize Kosovo's independence. The European Union foreign policy chief said that stability in Kosovo and the whole Balkan region is essential, and urged everyone to act calmly and responsibly. EDITOR'S NOTE : The development could not come at a worse time for US-Russian relations. Washington needs Moscow's cooperation with respect to Iran and the war against Islamism in general. But Russia will surely blame Washington for Kosovo's independence, seeing it as an aggressive, imperialist act--a move aimed at changing the status quo--and an invitation to renewed chaos in the Balkans. The AP reported Sunday: Russia is a traditional ally of Serbia. But that is not the only reason it vehemently opposes Kosovo's independence. The Kremlin contends it will set a dangerous precedent for secessionist movements across the former Soviet Union, including Chechnya and Georgia. It is difficult to understand why the US under President George W. Bush has seemingly gone out of its way following the 9/11 Islamist/Al Qaeda attacks--the worst-ever attacks on US soil --to alienate post-Soviet-era Russia. Three out of the last four prime ministers elected in Kosovo were senior members of the Al Qaeda-connected Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Hashim Thaci, was the leader of the KLA. The KLA has been credibly linked to Al Qaeda leader Osama Binladen. In 1998, Fatos Klosi, the head of SHIK (Albania's intelligence service), told London's Sunday Times newspaper that Binladen had visited Albania to send units to fight in Kosovo. In 1999, the Washington Times reported that it had obtained intelligence documents that showed a &quot;link&quot; between Binladen and the KLA--including a common staging area in Tropoje, Albania, a center for Islamic terrorists. The KLA's terrorist character was no secret. In 1998, Robert Gelbard, the US special envoy for Kosovo, told AFP that &quot;the KLA is, without any questions, a terrorist group.&quot;

CONTEXT	 [Updated] Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway together on screen again?  2009-06-03T17:38:00   Wet Dark and Wild  Update: TNMC has now removed its post - hmmmm - although (at the moment) TNMC's link to it on the Jake Gyllenhaal discussion board on ProIMDb is still there: 'by deadpooltnmc 3 hours ago (Wed Jun 3 2009 09:46:07) More details here: http://www.tnmc.org/Good-Movies-of-the-Future/brokeback-reunion.html' - Make of that what you will - so what was their reason for publishing and what was their reason for deleting? They had no source and made it up (posting links to their story on the Jake and Anne threads on IMDb) or they published prematurely? Time will tell. WHAM! I didn't see this coming! And I don't know where it's come from or where it's going - I can find no corrobarative source. TNMC and TNMC alone have announced this today: 'Director Ed Zwick (The Last Samurai, Defiance) has tapped Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway to star in LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS. 20th Century Fox and New Regency are financing the film which will begin shooting on September 21st 2009. Scott Stuber, Edward Zwick, Marshall Herskovitz and Pieter Jan Brugge are producing the film. Charles Randolph wrote the screenplay which has been rewritten by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz. I've been able to confirm that this project is the former UNTITLED CHARLES RANDOLPH which was featured in the 2007's Black List. Here's the synopsis:“A humorous expose of the highly competitive and cutthroat world of pharmaceuticals, where salesmen schmooze doctors, nurses and hospitals to get them to use their brand of drugs.”' The Black List mentioned was a list of the most popular unproduced scripts of 2007. One site elaborated: 'UNTITLED CHARLES RANDOLPH PHARMACEUTICALS SCRIPT by Charles Randolph. “A humorous expose of the highly competitive and cutthroat world of pharmaceuticals, where salesmen schmooze doctors, nurses and hospitals to get them to use their brand of drugs.” AGENT: Creative Artists Agency - Rowena Arguelles, Risa Gertner. MANAGER: Brillstein Entertainment Partners - Margaret Riley. UNAVAILABLE. Universal.' One blogger at the time had this to say about the script: 'UNTITLED CHARLES RANDOLPH PHARMACEUTICAL SCRIPT was a really fun read. Think Thank You For Smoking with cutthroat pharmaceutical reps. Would love to see this get made with a great cast.' After some searching around, this description of 'A humorous expose...' was also used to describe a movie that didn't happen for ' Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman ', written by pharmaceutical rep Jamie Reidy. Charles Randolph is listed as the producer and writer so this is clearly the same project. What of the other names? Ed Zwick was the Oscar winning producer for Shakespeare in Love and was the director and writer of the recent Defiance starring Daniel Craig. As for Anne Hathaway... Who wouldn't want to see Jake and Anne act together again? And then there's the date - 21 September. Is this a date to write in the diary? I know that we're all fit to burst waiting for one of Jake's films to actually come out - another potential movie in the pipeline doesn't help. But I like dates, give me a date. Includes pictures from IHJ .  2009-06-03T19:38:00  Unfortunately, this possible news thwarted this evening's post - but it is coming, Olympia! Hi Jake Fan! It is cool :D Hey there Winterbird :D I totally agree - I want to see the projects line up for Jake so that we have many films to enjoy after this long drought. And this is interesting, isn't it? Anne is a huge bonus, but also a good story - whistleblowing pharmaceutical reps, humour, scandal etc - and an interesting director. I enjoyed Last Samurai alot, actually, although I expected to hate it, and there are some other good ones of Ed's cv, although I've not seen Defiance yet. Yep, this has my vote too. And it's worth repeating - love to see Jake and Anne on screen together, sparking off one another. I like the date... Damn Yankees might have been in Variety but there was no sign of a date. Rendition was a quickie, this could be another. I seem to be thinking outloud again! I just love the sound of this. I so hope this is going to happen. It would be great to have Anne and Jake work together again:) Sounds like a good project aswell. Have to say I really liked Natalie Portman's interview with Jim Sheridan. It was interesting to hear him talk about the cultural differences between himself and Jake and Natalie. It's making me want to see Brothers even more. I'm intrigued by your main post tonight WDW. Another Jake body parts one...hopefully:)  2009-06-03T20:44:00  Hi Carol! It sounds great - all the ingredients I'd want. I'd find it interesting too as I worked in pharmaceutical publishing for three years and it was quite an experience being part of that world. The gifts that I was offered by reps... A world away from my archaeology digging and writing life! I'm glad you liked the Jim and Natalie interview - it intrigued me and it did make me want to see Brothers all the more!  2009-06-03T20:57:00  I'm not objective either, Paul, and I totally agree! It would be GREAT! I'm worried to cross my fingers, but I will....  2009-06-03T21:00:00   BBMISwear  Wow, this does sound good - and I would LOVE to see Jake and Anne on screen together again but I refuse to let myself get excited...LOL! Jake's name has been attached to so many movies lately it would be impossible for him to do all of them (but I wouldn't mind if he did...keep him busy for a while...ha ha)! Thanks for the great info WDW...and you're right...didn't see this coming at all. Been meaning to mention that I'm a bit bothered by the Jim Sheridan interview - it was a good interview (love Natalie's new website) and informative and only added to my excitement for this movie as I have thought since seeing the original trailer for the original Brothers movie so long ago that I will love this movie...the story line is simply wonderful, IMHO. But...I just do not like a word Jim has to say about Jake!! I thought he was insulting, actually. And I don't agree with him at all. But what do I know?! I've only watched all of Jake's movies over and over and over... *wonders how many Jake movies Jim Sheridan has actually watched*  2009-06-03T21:19:00   Anonymous  I would LOVE to see Jake and Anne together. They made such a wonderful couple in BBM (though it was actually Ennis that Jack wanted to be with) they have such nice chemistry together. I hope this is real. I read an article about the moon project and it just didn't seem very well written.  2009-06-03T21:36:00  Well... whaddyaknow - as Anon spotted, TNMC have now removed the story from their site, leaving (for the moment) links to it on the discussion pages for Jake and Anne on ProIMDb/IMDb. So what was their reason for publishing and what was their reason or deleting? Hey BBMISwear - I know what you mean by the Sheridan interview. You listen to a good interview and suddenly at the end there's a sting in the tail and Jake is singled out. Of course we're biased but I think we know a bit about Jake's acting abilities after these years :) Thanks for letting me know, Anon :D Well, that's intriguing. What's got them so worried. It makes me wonder that maybe this was true but they didn't think anyone would pick up on it - but then why publish links on the discussion ProIMDb boards which is where I found it! Very strange! Hi Jake Fan - that is a temptation :) Hi Sweetpea! I did a post about The Moon Project a couple of days ago - it sounds quite intriguing! I hope this story is true but I wonder about the motives of TNMC now they've deleted their post. Hi there Jackie! I hope it's true too - but who knows... Hi Monica! I think Anne will be wonderful as Judy Garland - I was blown away by her performance at the Oscars. I hope this is true too, Get Real :) It seems strange to make it up - I'm hoping they deleted it because they were given this info but couldn't back it up. The date is interesting. Jake and Anne would be a joy on the screen again! Hi Paul :) I think Anne is the HW actress I admire, like and respect the most these days. She's made a few duds but on the whole it's so hard not to warm to the characters she creates. She's extremely likeable and believable on the screen. She has an amazing future. And agreed about the Jim Sheridan quote. For me, it also has a lot to do with culture difference.  2009-06-03T23:00:00  It's Ok WDW, I can be patient! :D And this news, even if it's unverified, is very interesting. I would love to see Jake and Anne do another movie together and that script sounds fun. And we all know Jake and Anne can do humor very well. I had never seen that picture of Anne, Peter and Jake, it's great. And don't Jake and Anne look lovely together in that last one? Just stunning! It's always nice to see BBM promo pictures.  2009-06-04T04:53:00   Bertie  I like this idea - a lot. Both the storyline and the stars! I loved The Last Samurai and Defiance, haven't seen Thank You For Smoking. :)  2009-06-04T06:46:00   Uli  Wow, I am curious to see what will come of this... With a shooting start date and all the other info it sounded so real!! And it would be lovely if it was true! I would love to see Jake and Anne on screen together again! But could please somebody sort out all of Jake's potential projects for us and give us a schedule??? There are so many - and I want to know which of them are for real... Not sure what to think about Jim Sheridan's comment about Jake... Morning everyone! Hi Bertie! I like the idea a lot too. Fingers crossed for more news on it soon. Uli! I know just what you mean! Give us a schedule! Give Jake a schedule... (((Uli))) Have a much better day today *)  2009-06-04T15:07:00   paulh  All you need to know about Jake and Anne is a picture of them standing next to each other. Some people just go together perfectly, and they do. Rene Zellweger and Ewan McGregor are another great pair.

CONTEXT	 Vanilla Ice Busted!  2008-04-11T14:06:00   ????  90's white rapper Robert Van Winkle , better known to the world as Vanilla Ice , was arrested in his Palm Beach County, Florida home last night on the charge of domestic battery on his wife -- too cold, too cold ... TMZ has the available deets , natch: Former rap star Vanilla Ice, real name Robert Van Winkle, was arrested tonight at his home after an alleged altercation with his wife. Ice was booked by Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputies at 10:43 PM ET on a charge of domestic battery. Sources tell TMZ he got into an argument with his wife, Laura, and he pushed her. Vanilla Ice is still in custody at Palm Beach County Jail. Palm Beach County Sheriff's tell TMZ that in most cases, people arrested for domestic violence are usually held over to see a judge. Looks like Mr. Van Winkle will spend a night in the pokey. From the sound of it, it appears that there may be nothing at all to this altercation ... whether or not he really battered his wife, the details thus far do not make it seem like anything of substance will come from this incident. To be completely honest, I'm just stunned at how quickly Vanilla Ice 's mug shot made its way to the InterWeb ... sometimes the photo never gets released but in jurisdictions where celebrity mug shot releases are common place the photos make their way half way around the world before the accused is even fingerprinted. What a world, what a world. [ Source ] [ ]

History will not judge this kindly.") ------  Sources: Top Bush Advisors Approved 'Enhanced Interrogation' Detailed Discussions Were Held About Techniques to Use on al Qaeda Suspects By JAN CRAWFORD GREENBURG, HOWARD L. ROSENBERG and ARIANE de VOGUE April 9, 2008 In dozens of top-secret talks and meetings in the White House, the most senior Bush administration officials discussed and approved specific details of how high-value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency, sources tell ABC News. The so-called Principals who participated in the meetings also approved the use of "combined" interrogation techniques -- using different techniques during interrogations, instead of using one Highly placed sources said a handful of top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects -- whether they would be slapped, pushed, deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning, called waterboarding. techniques" were so detailed, these sources said, some of the The high-level discussions about these "enhanced interrogation interrogation sessions were almost choreographed -- down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic. The advisers were members of the National Security Council's Principals Committee, a select group of senior officials who met frequently to advise President Bush on issues of national security policy. At the time, the Principals Committee included Vice President Cheney, former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell, as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft. he discussions and meetings occurred in an atmosphere of great concern the extraordinary involvement of the senior advisers in the grim that another terror attack on the nation was imminent. Sources said details of exactly how individual interrogations would be conducted showed how seriously officials took the al Qaeda threat. It started after the CIA captured top al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah in spring 2002 in Faisalabad, Pakistan. When his safe house was raided by Pakistani security forces along with FBI and CIA agents, Zubaydah was shot three times during the gun battle. At a time when virtually all counterterrorist professionals viewed another attack as imminent -- and with information on al Qaeda scarce -- the detention of Zubaydah was seen as a potentially critical breakthrough. Zubaydah was taken to the local hospital, where CIA agent John Kiriakou, who helped coordinate Zubaydah's capture, was ordered to remain at the wounded captive's side at all times. "I ripped up a Thailand, he was uncooperative. "I told him I had heard he was being a jerk," Kiriakou recalled. "I said, 'These guys can make it easy on you or they can make it hard.' It was after that he became defiant." The CIA wanted to use more aggressive -- and physical -- methods to get information. The agency briefed high-level officials in the National Security Council's Principals Committee, led by then-National Security Advisor Rice and including then-Attorney General Ashcroft, which then signed committee objected to the CIA's plans for Zubaydah. The CIA has confirmed Zubaydah was one of three al Qaeda suspects subjected to waterboarding. After he was waterboarded, officials say Zubaydah gave up valuable information that led to the capture of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammad and fellow 9/11 plotter Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Mohammad was also subjected to waterboarding by the CIA. At a hearing before a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay on March 10, 2007, KSM, as he is known, said he broke under the harsh interrogation. Lawyers in the Justice Department had written a classified memo, which was extensively reviewed, that gave formal legal authority to government interrogators to use the "enhanced" questioning tactics on suspected terrorist prisoners. The August 2002 memo, signed by then head of the Office of Legal Counsel Jay Bybee, was referred to as the so-called "Golden Shield" for CIA agents, who worried they would be held liable if the harsh interrogations became public. covert operations, from the Vietnam War-era "Phoenix Program" of Old hands in the intelligence community remembered vividly how past assassinations of Viet Cong to the Iran-Contra arms sales of the 1980s were painted as the work of a "rogue agency" out of control. But even after the "Golden Shield" was in place, briefings and meetings in the White House to discuss individual interrogations continued, sources said. Tenet, seeking to protect his agents, regularly sought confirmation from the NSC principals that specific interrogation plans were legal. According to a former CIA official involved in the process, CIA overstepping their boundaries, would await guidance in particularly for authorization for specific techniques. Agents, worried about complicated cases dealing with high-value detainees, two CIA sources said. Highly placed sources said CIA directors Tenet and later Porter Goss along with agency lawyers briefed senior advisers, including Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld and Powell, about detainees in CIA custody overseas. "It kept coming up. CIA wanted us to sign off on each one every time," said one high-ranking official who asked not to be identified. "They'd say, 'We've got so and so. This is the plan.'" Sources said that at each discussion, all the Principals present approved. "These discussions weren't adding value," a source said. "Once you make a policy decision to go beyond what you used to do and conclude it's legal, (you should) just tell them to implement it." Then-Attorney General Ashcroft was troubled by the discussions. He agreed with the general policy decision to allow aggressive tactics and had repeatedly advised that they were legal. But he argued that of interrogations, sources said. According to a top official, Ashcroft asked aloud after one meeting: "Why are we talking about this in the White House? History will not judge this kindly." The Principals also approved interrogations that combined different methods, pushing the limits of international law and even the Justice Department's own legal approval in the 2002 memo, sources told ABC Cheney, among others -- Tenet made an elaborate presentation for At one meeting in the summer of 2003 -- attended by Vice President approval to combine several different techniques during interrogations, instead of using one method at a time, according to a highly placed administration source. A year later, amidst the outcry over unrelated abuses of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib, the controversial 2002 legal memo, which gave formal legal authorization for the CIA interrogation program of the top al Qaeda suspects, leaked to the press. A new senior official in the Justice Department, Jack Goldsmith, withdrew the legal memo -- the Golden Shield -- that authorized the program. But the CIA had captured a new al Qaeda suspect in Asia. Sources said CIA officials that summer returned to the Principals Committee for approval to continue using certain "enhanced interrogation techniques." Then-National Security Advisor Rice, sources said, was decisive. Despite growing policy concerns -- shared by Powell -- that the program was harming the image of the United States abroad, sources say  2008-04-10T13:53:10  Oh really, good lets hope it happens to mindless anti-American fucks like you. news:f2b1c896-5eda-4734-b665-6ee3721e0a52@a23g2000hsc.googlegroups.com ...

NTPC has current capacity of 28000 MW and has target to achieve 66000 MW by 2017. (See this thread on NTPC). Around 2012 - 2013, both Tata Power is expected to have similar capacity as Reliance Power.The interesting thing is at current price of Rs 1457, Tata Power is valued at just Rs 30000 crore. Remove Rs 10000 crore of investments and you can have it only for Rs 20000 crore. At Rs 900, Reliance Power will have market value of 200000 crores.... 6.67 times that of Tata Power. ======================================== in FY 2007. With 28000 MW capacity, NTPC made standalone profit of Rs 6900 crore Lets assume Reliance Power turns out to be much more efficient than these two companies. Add to that increased power rates. With 28200 capacity, assume Reliance Power makes Rs 15000 crore of net worldwide trade at 10-15 times their earnings. profit in 2016-2017. Power companies are considered as utilities and Lets assume 15 times ratio for Reliance Power in 2016. What will be its market value? 15000 X 15 = Rs 225000 crore or Rs 995 per share. Butibori, Sasan, Shahpur Coal, Urthing Sobla as Rs 30000 crore+. The RHP mentions estimated cost of six projects Rosa I, Rosa II, Analysts estimate that Reliance Power will need Rs 70000 crore of debt to finance its projects which are estimated to cost 100000 crore+. Rs 70000 crore of debt is not going to come at 2% interest rate. Even derailment of plans may create major problems for this company. Reliance Power - The Overlooked Fact: Is Reliance Power just "Reliance Power"? No.It is actually "Reliance Power Limited" - a limited company. So what does this mean for Reliance Power Limited? It means if in the rare case, the calculations of the management go wrong and the company somehow goes to insolvency, none of the shareholders will lose anything except the value of the shares. If you are a share holder of Reliance Power and it goes into insolvency (unable to pay back debts), what do you stand to lose? in the IPO......which works out to be Rs 720 crore. each. Plus they will each subscribe to 1.6 crore shares each at Rs 450 Thus, AAA Project will be getting 101.6 crore shares of Reliance Power for Rs 1720 crore and REL will be getting 101.6 crore shares of Reliance Power for Rs 1720 crore. per share ; while investors will be risking Rs 450 per share. This is what both the promoters are risking in this project....Rs 17 This is exactly the reason why Reliance Power was created. First, by contributing just Rs 1720 crore each to Reliance Power, the promoters have shifted all risk to investors. Anil Ambani's Rs 1000 crore investment will be worth Rs 100000 crore out of thin air. when Reliance Power lists at Rs 900.If the gamble works, the promoters (holding 90% stake in Reliance Power) will be worth billions of dollars. and investors will lose Rs 10000+ crore which they will be paying for If the gamble doesn't work, the promoters will lose Rs 1720 crore each a mere 10% stake in Reliance Power. What a way to create wealth...!!!....I don't have words to describe the brilliance of Anil Ambani's plans... investments...........referring to Tata Power. with much smaller debt burden and Rs 10000 crore worth of If Reliance Power (at Rs 900) is available for Rs 200000 crore, why not buy NTPC for a similar price ......Rs 225000 crore. NTPC plans to have a capacity of 66000 MW in 2017, while Reliance Power will have marginally cash flows for next 5 years and Rs 70000+ crore of debt, Second, the risk is higher than other existing companies. With the risk for Reliance Power is high. Tata Power and NTPC have existing cash flows to handle expansions....Reliance Power does not. Third and the biggest factor is....the valuation of the company doesn't make much sense. Why should Reliance Power be valued at Rs 200000 crore, when in highly optimistic scenario, it will not make more than Rs 15000 crore of profit in 2016 ? Even if it touches that margins as NTPC. Also, I got the optimistic Rs 15000 crore figure by assuming two times The fact is..... at least till 2014, Reliance Power will still be carrying most of its Rs 70000 crore debt and its interest costs will squeeze margins to a large extent. investors would be possibly looking at listing gains and exit when and guess many like me are not looking at a 5 to 10 year horizon. Most Reliance Power gets listed. With many speculations floating around, the stock would surely list at anywhere between 60-100% premium. And then considering the 2010 to 2016 period, we may find a lot of entry There are a few who are perhaps looking at long term investments and think that it would do something like Reliance Industries did. However, I guess that would need a visionary like Dhirubhai himself, and no one like him has taken birth yet. Let's wait and watch if the "Reliance" and "Ambani" tags can create the same magic again :-) -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted for Academic Purpose.

CONTEXT	 OY ... I don't even want to go into how horrendous my flight home from Amsterdam was yesterday ... I'll just say that I'm glad I survived intact ... last night wasn't much fun either. I'm feeling a tiny bit better this morning ... so let's get to it ... Britney and Sean Preston Spears are spending some time vacationing in Hawaii ... and that bathing suit isn't really doing her any favors at all! And can we talk about her feet? I realize that her hooves look like they are caked in sand but they are very unappealing to look at ... which is why I'm calling attention to them ... what, do you think I want to be the only one suffering this A.M.? [ Source ] While Brit and SP are sunning themselves in Hawaii, Kevin Federline is home taking care of his business ... which looks like involves this mysterious blonde: I suppose these pictures could be totally innocent ... maybe she's his cousin or something ... altho, I wouldn't necessarily trust K-Fed to behave around his own cousin.

CONTEXT	 Check out these hilarious pictures of Adrien Brody on the set of his new bull-fighting movie Manolete : The Oscar-winning actor is wearing the bizarre costume for his new movie Manolete, also starring Penelope Cruz. The film tells the story of one of Spain's best-known matadors, who was finally killed in the bullring by a horn to the thigh. There is something to be said for Academy Award winning actors who have no problem flaunting their pink camel toes. [ Source ] What the hell is going on here? Is Elijah Wood living out some sort of fantasy? Do you suppose these screencaps come from a porn audition tape?

It's also hard to see any resemblance to MJ in the kid's faces ... the only thing that looks similar is that they're all white. [thanks Jenny ] TMZ.com shocks the world with a report on underage drinking in Hollywood ... here is a picture of Jesse McCartney enjoying La Cerveza Mas Fina at a Hollywood club: This photo of McCartney was taken last Saturday night at Mood, one of the hottest clubs in Hollywood. Under California law, no one under 21 is permitted to enter the club, much less drink inside. But the Corona in Jesse's firm grip tells a very different story ... A Hollywood nightclub promoter, who asked to remain anonymous, was blunt: "Authorities know that there are underage celebrities inside drinking and if they don't care, why should we?" He added the obvious: "Celebrities help to make our clubs more exclusive." I love how this report is supposed to be a wakeup call to cracking down on underage drinking ... they can't be serious. Celebs do and get away with whatever they want, whenever they want. [ Source ]

CONTEXT	 The court ruling allowing their marriage was specifically for this couple only. It remains to be seen if a precedent has been set. RELATED: Last week Mexico City legalized same-sex marriage, but that law has not yet gone into effect. Civil unions are available to gay couples in several Brazilian and Mexican states, and in the entire nation of Uruguay. Labels: Argentina , Buenos Aires , LGBT History , marriage equality After being temporarily thwarted by a judge's stay of a Buenos Aires court ruling in their favor, two men in Argentina have become the first gays to marry legally in Latin America. An official in Argentina's southern Tierra del Fuego province says two Argentine men have wed there in Latin America's first gay marriage. Provincial spokesman Eduardo Porter says the wedding between Jose Maria Di Bello and Alex Freyre took place at the civil registry in Ushuaia. Their marriage plans in Buenos Aires earlier this month were thwarted when city officials refused to marry them because of conflicting rulings. An official representing the federal government's antidiscrimination agency attended the wedding. Claudio Morgado called Monday's marriage "historic." Argentina's Constitution is silent on whether marriage must be between a man and a woman, effectively leaving the matter to state and city officials.

CONTEXT	 Well, shit. The engineer of the commuter train that crashed in California, killing 24 people, was apparently texting teenaged boys rather than watching the track signals. And he was gay . You know where this is going. In the years before his death, Sanchez led a nomadic life, with public records showing addresses in Oregon, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, Nebraska and California. In 2000, he and Daniel Charles Burton, a waiter, bought a home in Crestline. Burton moved to California from West Haven, Conn., his family said, seeking better weather and the freedom to be gay. No one in Burton's family knows how the two men met, but Burton and Sanchez ended up living together in Studio City before moving to the San Bernardino Mountains.

I could have SWORN the cost was $26, and I only had $25 in cash and had left my checkbook at my dorm, and, as you well know, they don't take credit/debit cards. I spent AN HOUR driving around looking for a friggin' Wells Fargo ATM, before I remembered that I had a spare checkbook (one of my replacements) in my trunk.  You can imagine my "delight" when I got up to the counter and the woman told me it would cost $24. If looks could kill, she would have had a hole through her forehead.

CONTEXT	 On Nov. 13, the MOF and the National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC), the country's top economic planner, jointly announced a decision to abolish administrative fees in areas such as business license applications, industrial construction, foreign trade, agricultural production, employment and education, among others. "The move supports the government's decision to stimulate domestic demand and promote economic growth," the MOF said on its web site. According to the ministry, such a "powerful" measure will help encourage company investment and social consumption. Meanwhile, financial departments at all levels have been ordered to properly arrange fiscal budgets and guarantee administration funds to tackle the decrease in governmental income caused by the fee cuts. In September, China ceased administrative charges on local markets and individual merchants, saving about 17 billion yuan for the related economic sector, MOF statistics showed.

CONTEXT	 The Czech Republic has come up with a novel way to deal with unemployment. The Czech Republic will offer a free plane ticket and 500 euros ($649) to foreign workers who voluntarily agree to return home after losing their jobs in the economic downturn, the government said on Monday. The sweeteners are among measures to cope with security risks stemming from rising unemployment among foreign workers in the EU member country, Interior Minister Ivan Langer said. In the past years, the fast-growing Czech economy, led by the car industry, lured cheap labor mainly from Ukraine, Slovakia, Vietnam, Mongolia and Moldova. Langer said many unemployed foreigners lacked cash to pay for a ticket home, as they had been saving to pay excessive fees or bribes -- up to $12,000 -- to agencies that secured them jobs in the Czech Republic. Czech unemployment is 6.8%, almost a full point lower than the United States.

Group C: England, USA, Algeria, Slovenia Best chance we've had in years. Expect another six months of reminders that we beat England 1-0 the first time we met in the World Cup, back in 1950. An excellent chance for Team USA to advance to the second round. Spain will likely win this group, in my opinion, with Honduras hard on their heels. Honduras and Chile don't share a border, so we won't expect war to break out if either side washes out of the first round. Team USA opens against England on June 12, 2010. It'll be fun!

CONTEXT	 The founder of DitchtheLabel is 17-year old student, activist and part-time model, Liam Hackett. He developed the site primarily aimed at marginalised teenagers looking to break free from social stereotypes based on race, sexuality or gender. The site aims to challenge negative stereotypes and provide a forum in which young people can share their experiences of prejudice and social labelling. Based in Manchester, the prodigious teen first launched the website via Myspace in July 2007 and since then, the Myspace page has attracted more than 50,000 visits. Liam looked into developing a more permanent website that would allow a greater expansion of the campaign. The new DitchtheLabel site was conceived after Liam secured a business grant from the local Chamber of Commerce, who recognised the site's appeal and potential.He was only the second person under 18 in in his region to obtain a business grant. Despite its early days, the website looks like it will become a flourishing internet resource for teenagers looking to break outside social stereotypes.

CONTEXT	 The NAACP is suing two major banks, claiming they engaged in racist lending practices. The NAACP filed lawsuits Friday against two of the nation's largest mortgage lenders -- HSBC and Wells Fargo -- alleging "systematic, institutionalized racism" in their subprime lending. NAACP CEO Benjamin Jealous says, "We are not seeking damages; we just want them to fix the problem." We have targeted these banks because we have gone through what we can get our hands on, and it seems like there's a real problem here," NAACP CEO Benjamin Jealous told CNN. Jealous said the group wants "transparency." "We want to see the books," he added. "We are not seeking damages; we just want them to fix the problem." [snip] Under subprime lending, people who don't qualify for lower interest rates can borrow money at higher rates. The NAACP argues that the companies gave subprime rates to African-Americans who qualified for better rates and gave better rates to white customers with similar credit histories.

I meet with people and I talk to them. Then based on a review of all of the facts, I report closet cases that hurt the gay community. You may not like my style, but I have a track record of 100%. And for those reasons I am now able to confirm a rumor that has circulated in South Carolina for years. South Carolina Lt. Governor Andre Bauer is a closeted anti-gay politician who stands to replace Mark Sanford should Sanford resign or be impeached (a real possibility as Sanford is caught in his own sex scandal.) Rumors have been swirling about Bauer for several months and have intensified since the Sanford scandal. In June, South Carolina Democratic congressional candidate Linda Ketner apologized after she outed Bauer , saying she thought she had been speaking off the record and had no direct knowledge of his gayness. As Mike Rogers notes in the quote above, he has a 100% track record in naming closeted gay politicians who are working against the rights of their own people.

CONTEXT	  antinomy <antin...@sbcglobal.net>   2008-03-24T01:15:00  So get your tax forms prepared. "surge." The improvement is real but fragile and limited. Here's what it amounts to: We've cut our casualty rates to the unacceptable levels that plagued us back in 2005, and we still don't have any exit plan for years to come -- all for a bill that is accumulating at the rate of almost $5,000 every second! More important, while casualties in Baghdad are down, we're beginning to take losses in Florida and California. The United States seems to have slipped into recession; Americans are losing their homes, jobs and health insurance; banks are struggling -- and the Iraq war appears to have aggravated all these domestic woes. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist. "It was at least "The present economic mess is very much related to the Iraq war," says partially responsible for soaring oil prices. ...Moreover, money spent on Iraq did not stimulate the economy as much as the same dollars spent at home would have done. To cover up these weaknesses in the hardships is so strong. Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs Not everyone agrees that the connection between Iraq and our economic International and author of a book on how America pays for wars, argues that the Iraq war is a negative for the economy but still only a minor factor in the present crisis. strengthen our economy? The answer is yes." For all the disagreement, there appears to be at least a modest connection between spending in Iraq and the economic difficulties at home. So as we debate whether to bring our troops home, one central question should be whether Iraq is really the best place to invest $411 million every day in present spending alone. I've argued that staying in Iraq indefinitely undermines our national security by empowering jihadis -- just as we now know that our military presence in Saudi Arabia in the 1990s was, in fact, counterproductive by empowering Al Qaeda in its early days. On the other hand, supporters of the war argue that a withdrawal from Iraq would signal weakness and leave a vacuum that extremists would fill, and those are But if you believe that staying in Iraq does more good than harm, you must answer the next question: Is that presence so valuable that it is worth undermining our economy? Granted, the cost estimates are squishy and controversial, partly because the $12.5 billion a month that we're now paying for Iraq is only a down payment. We'll still be making disability payments to Iraq war veterans 50 years from now. Professor Stiglitz calculates in a new book, written with Linda Bilmes of Harvard University, that the total costs, including the long-term bills we're incurring, amount to about $25 billion a month. That's $330 a month for a family of four. A Congressional study by the Joint Economic Committee found that the sums spent on the Iraq war each day could enroll an additional 58,000 children in Head Start or give Pell Grants to 153,000 students to agents, expand Head Start and rehabilitate America's image in the Imagine the possibilities. We could hire more police and border patrol world by underwriting a global drive to slash maternal mortality, eradicate malaria and deworm every child in Africa. All that would consume less than one month's spending on the Iraq war. Moreover, the Bush administration has financed this war in a way that undermines our national security -- by borrowing. Forty percent of the increased debt will be held by China and other foreign countries. "This is the first major war in American history where all the additional cost was paid for by borrowing," Mr. Hormats notes. If the war backers believe that the Iraq war is so essential, then they One way or another, now or later, we'll have to pay the bill. Professor Stiglitz calculates that the eventual total cost of the war will be about $3 trillion. For a family of five like mine, that amounts to a bill of almost $50,000.

The African Union and United Nations have also condemned the brutal supression of the popular protests by Guinea security authorities. The labour strike that has paralysed Guinea led to a bloody crackdown on political protests in which security forces have killed 44 people in two weeks.

CONTEXT	 Cedar Point will no longer be home to the world's tallest, fastest rollercoaster -- the new rollercoaster king is gonna be in New Jersey . JACKSON, N.J. - Six Flags Great Adventure is opening the world's tallest and fastest roller coaster this spring ? a thrill ride that accelerates to 128 mph in 3.5 seconds and rises 456 feet off the ground. Boo! My friends and I are going to Cedar Point in a few weeks to enjoy the rides before the park closes down for the season. Poor Eric McCormack (Will on Will & Grace ) -- apparently he was hoping to get a record contract or something . "Eric had been hoping to branch out and, in addition to doing 'Will & Grace,' wanted to do an easy listening album," said our source. "He was petitioning BMG for a contract and even performed live on 'Today,' but no one is biting after the poor sales." What I don't understand is if Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan can get record deals then ANYONE should be able to get a record deal. Sadly, one of The Weather Girls has died . Armstead, who along with partner Martha Wash started out as background singers for San Francisco disco diva Sylvester before forming the Weather Girls, died Sept. 16 of heart failure at a hospital in San Leandro, Calif., about 30 kilometres east of San Francisco. At least now she can enjoy all those nekked men in heaven full time now.

CONTEXT	 Second, what we are witnessing is not a "cycle" of violence. The IDF airstrikes are a reaction to the unrelenting rocket and mortar attacks against the Jewish state. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 in the hope that the Palestinians would use the opportunity to prepare for an eventual agreement and a two-state solution in which they would live side by side in peace with Israel. Since then, there have been more than 3,500 such attacks aimed at areas of southern Israel, including over 200 launches since Dec. 19, after Hamas chose not to extend a six-month truce. The expanding range of these missiles now covers an area populated by as many as 700,000 Israelis. Third, Israel and Hamas have profoundly different aims. Israel has accepted the principle of a two-state solution as the basis for ending the conflict. Hamas, by contrast, rejects this. Its language of "resistance" or "ending occupation" (even though no Israelis, civilian or military, other than the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit, have "occupied" Gaza for the past three years) is but a veiled expression of Hamas's actual objective: destroying Israel and creating an Islamist Palestinian state in its place. Credulous observers may see more peaceful purposes, but Hamas leaders periodically reassert these objectives, whether in the Hamas covenant or, in the words of a prominent Hamas cleric, Muhsen Abu 'Ita, speaking on Al-Aqsa TV and calling for "the annihilation of the Jews here in Palestine."

Last Updated(Beijing Time):2008-04-17 11:37 The Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a solemn representation with the Beijing office of Cable News Network (CNN) on Wednesday evening, condemning the network as "without any professional reputation". Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao, who is also the Director-General of the Ministry's Information Department, said that a statement issued by CNN on Tuesday failed to apologize for its host Jack Cafferty's remarks, which maliciously attacked the Chinese people and seriously violated the professional ethics of journalism. "CNN's ulterior motive to target the Chinese government and continue to mislead public opinion as well as deceive the Chinese people will never succeed", Liu said in a written statement issued late on Wednesday, stressing that justice would be on the side of the Chinese people. Cafferty said in a TV show on April 9 that the Chinese products are "junk" and the Chinese people "basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they've been for the last 50 years". Cafferty's remarks drew indignation from Chinese at home and abroad, and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu demanded an apology from CNN as well as Cafferty himself. CNN then issued a statement on Tuesday saying "it was not Mr. Cafferty's nor CNN's intent to cause offence to the Chinese people, and CNN would apologize to anyone who has interpreted the comments in this way". However, the network stated that Cafferty was offering his "strongly held" opinion of the Chinese government, not China's "We once again solemnly urge CNN and Cafferty to take back the vile remarks and make a sincere apology to all Chinese people", Liu stressed. They did not understand what the boy secretly meant to say.  The boy honorable network.  CNN is mistakenly trying to be loyal to a boy. said "Chinese people are inferior, and they make inferior products."

CONTEXT	 2007-09-09T11:10:00   GayandRight  The EU gives in to the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)....  THE CULMINATION of this carcinogenic process was last month's kick-off of a two-year plan to prepare and convene a Durban Review Conference in 2009 - Durban II. On the bureau or executive of the Conference preparatory committee are Libya as chair, Cuba as rapporteur, and Iran as a vice-chair. Such UN human rights authority figures began by deciding that the first substantive session of the Durban II festivities would coincide with almost the entire Jewish holiday of Pessah, thus inhibiting Jews worldwide from attending. Over the course of the week the European Union engaged in a gentlemanly tug-of-war with the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the African regional group - which is controlled by the OIC - over a range of terms and conditions. In the end, in an all-too-familiar pattern of behavior, the European Union threw in the towel - or in UN-speak "joined consensus." In addition to agreeing that Passover was a good date to hold a conference dedicated to combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, they came up with the following: The objectives of Durban II will no longer be limited to Durban "review," but will now be anything the OIC believes "include[s] assessing contemporary manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance." Pakistan crowed about the new agenda: the phrase "contemporary forms… allows for exhaustive discussion, to find ways to fight new forms to fight against racial profiling in the name of the fight against terrorism." In other words, the goal of Durban II will be to increase mass hysteria over allegations of global Islamophobia perpetrated by those fighting terrorism or publishing cartoons in an obscure Danish paper. AFTER THE train left the station, European Union diplomats shrugged off the results, claiming there was nothing they could have done. True, just doing the math makes it obvious that a controlling interest in the UN Human Rights Council, (which doubles as the Durban preparatory committee), is held by the OIC. They compose a majority on each of the African and Asian regional groups, who in turn hold the balance of power. But instead of insisting on a vote and making clear their opposition, the Europeans lent Durban II their support and decided to go along for the ride. It will be an expensive trip. It was revealed last week that $10.25 million was spent on Durban I, much of it coming from the EU. Instead of insisting, therefore, on some degree of control over the planning of Durban II, the Europeans capitulated at every step. The OIC insisted that only two UN investigators be issued specific invitations to provide Durban II with recommendations for combating racism. The two preferred investigators were the UN rapporteur on racism and related intolerance (who produces an annual report dedicated to Islamophobia) and the rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. The EU then "demanded" a specific invitation be issued to the UN rapporteur on freedom of expression. In response, here is what passes for human rights dialogue at the UN. Egypt, on behalf of the Africans, said: "The lack of freedom of expression, although condemnable, is not linked to racism... This reference is political in nature and not grounded in objectivity nor in technicality." Iran was even more to the point: "The special rapporteur on freedom of expression… is not acceptable."

The Green Party of Canada is a national party, which runs across our entire country, the Bloc and Reform parties never had this type of support yet they are included in the debates.

In a recent interview with the Deputy Leader of the Green Party, Claude William Genest, a candidate in the up-coming general election, I asked him what he thought about May’s exclusion. Mr. Genest stated, are they so afraid of?”. The Green Party receives federal funding from the taxpayers of Canada.

CONTEXT	 It looks like the long count/recount may be finally over as today Al Franken is scheduled to be formally declared the winner of his bitter Senate fight with Norm Coleman. Democrat Al Franken will be declared the winner of the tight U.S. Senate contest in Minnesota, emerging from a ballot recount with a slim margin over Republican Norm Coleman, state officials said on Sunday. But Coleman, the incumbent, has asked Minnesota's supreme court to require that a few hundred additional absentee ballots be included in the recount -- and he could then ask the court to investigate the contest all over again. "At the moment, Franken has a 225-vote lead," after the weekend counting of what were deemed the last uncounted absentee ballots, said Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie, a Democrat who oversaw the process. Ritchie said unless the supreme court acts on Coleman's request and orders more ballots to be counted, he will reconvene the state's Canvassing Board on Monday to certify Franken as the winner of the November 4 contest. Coleman is expected to continue to challenge the results.

CONTEXT	 Net profit slides at India's Maruti in fourth quarter Top Indian car maker Maruti Suzuki announced Thursday a 33.6 percent fall in net profit in the fourth quarter, hit by increased competition and rising input and depreciation costs.Maruti, majority owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp., reported net profit of 2.98 billion rupees (74 million dollars) against 4.49 billion rupees for the fourth quarter ended March For the full-year 2007-2008, Maruti's profit rose 10.9 percent to 17.8 billion rupees on sales that climbed 23.2 percent to 188.23 billion rupees. Maruti shares fell 15.2 rupees or two percent to close at 745.95, after recovering from the day's low of 728.7. Its earnings were seen as in-line with expectations. Maruti, which commands the lion's share of the fast-growing Indian car market, posted record sales in the fiscal year through to March 2008, at 764,842 vehicles. "Maruti's earnings met expectations. The company is likely to show strong sales in the year to March 2009 with new products in the pipeline," said Abhishek Banerjee, an automobile analyst with "Maruti's strategy is focussed on rural market expansion and innovation," he said. Maruti Udyog changed its official name earlier this year to Maruti Suzuki India.

Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, who leads campaigns claiming condoms are unsafe and opposing emergency contraception. According to Mr. Tancredo, a Colorado Republican, emergency contraception "cheapens human life and simply uses a woman's body to dispose of the child instead of a doctor."

The boy is alleged to have boarded a vacant school bus and released the parking brake, after which the bus rolled down a hill and struck a young girl, killing her.  My heart aches for the young girl's parents, but geez, folks, have we completely lost our perspective in our thirst for vengence? Must every stupid mistake be made into a crime? This is a young boy being mischevious, albeit with tragic results, and he has been charged with negligent homicide. There used to be a doctrine in the law that kids below a certain age could not be charged with criminal offenses because they were not mature enough to form the requisite criminal intent. If we are down to charging 8 year old boys with murder, I guess we've thrown that doctrine out the window. In this day and age , he must pay!

ABN planned to follow the sale of LaSalle to Bank of America by selling the rest of the company to Britain's Barclays PLC for about $91 billion (euro67.1 billion). A three-bank consortium led But in its lawsuit, Bank of America argues ABN "is contractually obligated to proceed with the LaSalle transaction whether or not it merges with Barclays (or any other party or no party at all)." The Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Superior Court ruled Thursday that Barclays' bid for ABN was dependent on the LaSalle sale and so interwoven with the takeover bid that shareholders should have been allowed to vote on it. ABN unsuccessfully argued In its lawsuit, Bank of America argues the LaSalle offer is not tied to the deal with Barclays. Bank of America said its agreement with ABN does include a "go shop" clause, but that only allows ABN Amro to entertain a higher offer for LaSalle -- and not ABN Amro as a whole. "Even if ABN AMRO were to pursue a sale of the entire company, it would be required to sell LaSalle to Bank of America," the suit said. Under the original agreement, another buyer -- such as the consortium led by RBS -- could offer a competing bid for LaSalle by Sunday. Bank of America would then have five business days to match the higher offer. If Bank of America declined to match that Thursday, the Dutch court said Groenink had "misunderstood" his back the proposed takeover offer from Barclays, and in its ruling duties when he attempted to sell LaSalle. "The decision of the management board to go ahead with the LaSalle sale without shareholder approval was based on the advice of three external law firms," said ABN Amro spokesman Neil Moorhouse. "The boards have taken the best decision under the Bank of America said buying LaSalle is critical to its long-term strategy and "represents a unique and irreplaceable business opportunity," the loss of which would cause "irreparable damage."

But when combined with LaSalle's 141 Chicago area offices, Bank of America would have more than 14 percent of the deposit market share in Chicago and move past JPMorgan Chase "LaSalle is one of only two potential acquisition targets that could give Bank of America a meaningful presence in that market and the other bank is not for sale," the lawsuit said.

One would expect him to have gone down in quotations books on subjects like war and the economy. Surprisingly, what George W Bush is most quoted for is his famous slip-of-the-tongue. This page is a top 10 list of George Bush quotes, or Bushisms as they are popularly called. 1. We need an energy bill that encourages consumption. 2. When Iraq is liberated, you will be treated, tried, and persecuted as a war criminal. 3. Sometimes, Washington is one of these towns where the person - people who think they've got the sharp elbow is the most effective person. 4. I promise you I will listen to what has been said here, even though I wasn't here. 5. I know what I believe. I will continue to articulate what I believe and what I believe - I believe what I believe is right. 6. For every fatal shooting, there were roughly three non-fatal shootings. And, folks, this is unacceptable in America. It's just unacceptable. And we're going to do something about it. 7. It's very important for folks to understand that when there's more trade, there's more commerce. 8. You teach a child to read, and he or her will be able to pass a literacy test. 9. Natural gas is hemispheric. I like to call it hemispheric in nature because it is a product that we can find in our neighborhoods.

CONTEXT	 2009-12-03T00:00:00     This is major, especially for New York City. General Electric has agreed to sell a controlling interest in NBC Universal to Comcast Cable.  The agreement will create a joint venture, with Comcast owning 51 percent and G.E. owning 49 percent. Comcast will contribute to the joint venture its stable of cable channels, which includes Versus, the Golf Channel and E Entertainment, worth about $7.25 billion, and will pay G.E. about $6.5 billion in cash, for a total of $13.75 billion. For now, the network will remain NBC Universal, but ultimately Comcast could decide to change the name. Almost immediately, the transaction reshapes the nation’s entertainment industry, giving a cable provider a huge portfolio of new content, even as it raises the sector’s anxieties about the future. The deal is valued at $30B and may take 18 months before getting the approval of the FCC. NBC's world headquarters is expected to remain in NYC for now.

CONTEXT	 Oman Telecommunications Company (Omantel) and Middle East and North Africa Company (MENA) of Egypt have signed a deal on the landing of a submarine fiber optics cable on the Omani coasts to enhance the Gulf country's international telecom traffic, the English daily Oman Tribune reported on Saturday. The cable landing point will be in Al Seeb, a district 30 km west of the Omani capital of Muscat, where the Omantel Submarine Cables Center is located, according to the report. The cable will improve Oman's international telecom traffic, especially the Internet, and in case of any other cable breakage, provide alternative lines as well as offer upgradable facilities to support Internet, e-commerce, video, data and voice, Omantel's CEO Mohammed Bin Ali Al Wohaibi said. In addition to the deal with MENA company, Omantel had recently joined 15 telecom companies in signing the Europe-India Gateway project for building a broadband cable from Britain to India via Oman, he added.

The plan targets grain production of at least 500 billion kg by 2010 and more than 540 billion kg by 2020. Output was 501.6 billion kg last year.

CONTEXT	 Economists cut back forecasts for U.S. economic growth A string of downbeat economic reports, including evidence that companies are paring back investment spending and signs that housing is taking another hit, have prompted economists to reduce their forecasts for U.S. economic growth in the first half of 2007, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Since late last year, forecasters have warned that economic growth in 2007 would be weaker than in 2006, due to a slump in housing construction and reduced production by American auto As the housing and auto slumps have deepened while business spending has started to wane, economists are taking another look at their forecasts for the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic activity, the report said. Earlier this month, said the report, the consensus estimate of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal said that GDP would grow by about 2.3 percent in the first quarter, down from an estimate of 2.5 percent a month earlier. The forecast for the second quarter was unchanged at 2.4 percent. spending will be considerably weaker," Nariman Behravesh, chief more prolonged than any of us have been thinking, and capital U.S. economist at consulting firm Global Insight, was quoted as saying. The firm lowered its forecast of first-quarter GDP growth to 1.6 percent from 2.2 percent. Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic consulting firm based in St Louis, lowered its forecast to 1.4 percent from 1.7 percent. Economists at Morgan Stanley reduced their tracking of first- quarter GDP growth to 1.4 percent from 1.6 percent; the firm's estimate had been as high as 2.2 percent in mid-March, the report said. Last year, U.S. gross domestic product grew at an inflation- adjusted 3.3 percent.

CONTEXT	 2006-11-15T17:19:00   andrewlza  While Malaysia fiddles, its opportunities are running dry  Michael Backman November 15, 2006 MALAYSIA'S been at it again, arguing about what proportion of the economy each of its two main races - the Malays and the Chinese - owns. (Read here, here, here) It's an argument that's been running for 40 years. That wealth and race are not synonymous is important for national cohesion, but really it's time Malaysia grew up. It's a tough world out there and there can be little sympathy for a country that prefers to argue about how to divide wealth rather than get on with the job of creating it. Many shares have a par value of say $1 but a market value of $12. And so the Government figure (18.9 per cent is the most recent figure) is a gross underestimate. Last month a paper by a researcher at a local think-tank came up with a figure of 45 per cent based on actual stock prices. All hell broke loose. The paper was withdrawn and the researcher resigned in protest. Part of the problem is that he is Chinese. "Malaysia boleh!" is Malaysia's national catch cry. It translates to "Malaysia can!" and Malaysia certainly can. Few countries are as good at wasting money. It is richly endowed with natural resources and the national obsession seems to be to extract these, sell them off and then collectively spray the proceeds up against the wall. This all happens in the context of Malaysia's grossly inflated sense of its place in the world. Most Malaysians are convinced that the eyes of the world are on their country and that their leaders are world figures. This is thanks to Malaysia's tame media and the bravado of former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. The truth is, few people on the streets of London or New York could point to Malaysia on a map much less name its prime minister or capital city. As if to make this point, a recent episode of The Simpsons features a newsreader trying to announce that a tidal wave had hit some place called Kuala Lumpur. He couldn't pronounce the city's name and so made up one, as if no-one cared anyway. But the joke was on the script writers - Kuala Lumpur is inland. Petronas, the national oil company is well run, particularly when compared to the disaster that passes for a national oil company in neighbouring Indonesia. But in some respects, this is Malaysia's problem. The very success of Petronas means that it is used to underwrite all manner of excess. The KLCC development in central Kuala Lumpur is an example. It includes the Twin Towers, the tallest buildings in the world when they were built, which was their point. It certainly wasn't that there was an office shortage in Kuala Lumpur - there wasn't. Malaysians are very proud of these towers. Goodness knows why. They had little to do with them. The money for them came out of the ground and the engineering was contracted out to South Korean companies. They don't even run the shopping centre that's beneath them. That's handled by Australia's Westfield. Next year, a Malaysian astronaut will go into space aboard a Russian rocket - the first Malay in space. And the cost? $RM95 million ($A34.3 million), to be footed by Malaysian taxpayers. The Science and Technology Minister has said that a moon landing in 2020 is the next target, aboard a US flight. There's no indication of what the Americans will charge for this, assuming there's even a chance that they will consider it. But what is Malaysia getting by using the space programs of others as a taxi service? There are no obvious technical benefits, but no doubt Malaysians will be told once again, that they are "boleh". The trouble is, they're not. It's not their space program. (But we can get into the Guiness Book of World Records to play games in space! Yay!) Back in July, the Government announced that it would spend $RM490 million on a sports complex near the London Olympics site so that Malaysian athletes can train there and "get used to cold weather". So what is the complex's real purpose? The dozens of goodwill missions by ministers and bureaucrats to London to check on the centre's construction and then on the athletes while they train might provide a clue. Bank bale outs, a formula one racing track, an entire new capital city - Petronas has paid for them all. It's been an orgy of nonsense that Malaysia can ill afford. Why? Because Malaysia's oil will run out in about 19 years. As it is, Malaysia will become a net oil importer in 2011 - that's just five years away. So it's in this context that the latest debate about race and wealth is so sad. It is time to move on, time to prepare the economy for life after oil. But, like Nero fiddling while Rome burned, the Malaysian Government is more interested in stunts like sending a Malaysian into space when Malaysia's inadequate schools could have done with the cash, and arguing about wealth distribution using transparently ridiculous statistics. That's not Malaysia "boleh", that's Malaysia "bodoh" (stupid). To Malaysian readers, from Michael Backman The response to my recent column 'While Malaysia fiddles, its opportunities are running dry', published in The Age newspaper on November 15 has been overwhelming. I've received hundreds of e-mails and messages, many from Malaysians both in Malaysia and outside. Thank you for these. It seems that the column has given voice to concerns that many Malaysians have. I'd like to emphasise (and as many of you realise already), that I wrote the column as constructive criticism. I like Malaysia very much. I visit often and have many Malaysian friends of all races. I've also written a lot that is positive about Malaysia in the past, most notably in a previous book of mine - The Asian Insider: Unconventional Wisdom for Asian Business, which has no less than five chapters to explain to people outside Malaysia why I feel that Malaysia should be given more credit than it gets. There have been many achievements. There is much about which Malaysians can be proud. Malaysia, for example, is far more politically mature and developed than is Singapore. The media is more open too (but of course not as open as it could or should be.) Malaysians are more entrepreneurial too. AirAsia started in Malaysia and has revolutionised air travel across Asia. In Singapore, there is very much a sense that the government has to do everything. I also believe that the NEP, which has seen special advantages given to bumiputeras over other groups, has been important for Malaysia. It has been essential for nation building. Malaysia is peaceful and while the various groups may not mix much there is clear mutual respect between them. That is a huge achievement. However, the problem as I said in my column, is waste. And also the use of statistics that are blatantly wrong. Malaysia also has a big problem with transparency. Too little account is made of how other people's money is spent. The police too are way too corrupt for a country as developed as Malaysia. The rote learning that is practiced in the schools also needs to be done away with. Generations of Malaysian children are missing out on an education that should teach them how to be creative and critical - this is what a truly modern, boleh country needs. Again, my comments are meant to be constructive. And I make them as a non-Malaysian largely because many Malaysians feel rightly or wrongly that they cannot say these things themselves in their own country. Since my column was published, plans for a new RM400 million Istana have been announced and the Agriculture Ministry parliamentary secretary has told Parliament that Malaysia's first astronaut will be playing batu seremban and spinning tops and making teh tarik while in space. There are countless scientists around the world who would give anything for the opportunity to go to space and do real experiments. For the Malaysian government to send an astronaut into space to play Malay children's games serves only to re-emphasise my point about waste. Not only that, it makes Malaysia look infantile in the eyes of the rest of the world, which is a great pity when Malaysia has made so many real achievements. The world is getting more clever, more competitive and more dynamic every day. There are too many in Malaysia who don't seem to understand this. Of course my views are just that: my views. But I have spent most of my adult life analysing and writing about Asia. I am direct and critical; I do not veil my criticisms because I don't want to waste my time or yours with readers trying to guess what I really mean. Open debate is absolutely critical for all modern, dynamic countries. The free flow of ideas and information helps to make countries rich. Political leaders cannot do everything on their own be they in the UK, Australia or Malaysia. They need help. Otherwise they make mistakes. And when they do, whose fault is that? Those who prefer to stay quiet? And should I as a non-Malaysian be commenting on Malaysia? Of course. Malaysian political leaders and commentators routinely comment about other countries. That's how the world is now, an inter-dependent, global world. And the world is much better for it. I will write another column about Malaysia soon.

CONTEXT	 DEFENDER: Working on it Arden. As with the whole "plot holes" issue, this movie didn't really have "loose ends" that weren't tied up because it didn't really have an ending at ALL, at least in the traditional sense. Whereas some recent movies (see Return of the King ) have had about 4-6 endings, this movie has about 20, but they're all smeared together, creating an ending block of film that I can only describe as "ending-ish". Great visuals though. ARDEN: Ok. So we both agree that the film looks great. And if you were on some sort of drug, it would probably look even better. But as far as the point of the whole Godforsaken thing, we're going on a combination of plot holes and an "ending-ish". It was sort of about Hugh Jackman and how much he loved Rachel Weisz, right? DEFENDER: Sort of. I think most guys who read this understand that whole psuedo-masochistic fantasy of "there's this perfect woman, but I can't have her because she's dying, and my protective instinct is frustrated by it's inability to do ANYTHING". It's not a pleasurable thing; it's romantic to men in the sense that Center Stage is romantic to women: there's no rhyme or reason to either progression of events. Somehow, our gender finds the helpless, dying, perfect woman thing really hot. She doesn't even have to have a reason for being perfect, as this movie clearly shows - she just has to be incredibly pretty, and we'll just assume she's perfect enough for us to fill in the blanks. ARDEN : Center Stage?! WTF! Ok... I've seen it a couple times. Anyway, so Rachel Weisz is dying and there's nothing Hugh Jackman can do to stop it. It's a masculine fantasy love story. Except!!! The story takes place in three different centuries. One, in Spain during the Inquisition. Two, during present day. Three, during LORD KNOWS WHEN in the future. God! I am boring myself talking about this. Maybe if we could figure out what genre Aronofsky was planning on all this happening in... DEFENDER: I can speak for all my fellow nerds out there when I say I was really hoping for something along the lines of 2001 . I was expecting cracked out, but I was also expecting, I don't know, a NARRATIVE?? Really, I know it's not new, or original , or as druggy , but I think this movie would've worked a lot better if it had taken place in chronological order. The biggest problem with the film is that I didn't even know if it was OUT of chronological order. I mean, Aronofsky doesn't have Shymalan's problem with exposition, because he doesn't tell us everything. However, he DOES have a problem with exposition because the amount of this I was expected to assume and was not convinced of was ridiculous. I didn't know whether the guy travelling to the nebula was the same guy whose wife was dying of cancer, and I didn't know if the conquistador even EXISTED. Come to think of it, were ANY of these guys in existence? Is the future guy the figment of the modern guy's imagination or vice-versa? I don't think any derivative of the word "explain" is in Aronofsky's vocabulary. ARDEN: No kidding. It was disappointing as Requiem for a Dream is possibly the best film adaptation of a book in all of recorded history. In that film, working from excellent source material, Aronofsky's style fit downward-spiraling drug addiction like a glove. His percussive editing and reoccuring themes can simulate hell on earth or can coast by your eyes; ecstactically fluid. In The Fountain , Aronofsky is working with self-created mythology rather than a solid story. And as much as you want it to work, it doesn't. I spent a good amount of the run-time convincing myself I was watching an important film. But then Jackman would cry like a wuss or something completely bizarre would happen and I'd think: "This... this is stupid." DEFENDER: I think Jackman was a little too gay for this part. Just a little. If I had been watching a man I could believe was actually in love with Rachel Weisz, this would be easier to stomach. Geez, this movie was weird. I just couldn't tell whether Aronofsky was actually SAYING anything. I think that was the issue. I wanted to watch the movie and feel something, and at a couple moments, I did. But then I didn't. I just didn't see the purpose in going to the film. I watched Munich because it showed the evil of man. I watched Casino Royale because it showed me what an action movie was supposed to look like. I watched Pirates of the Carribean II because it was damn good fun. But why did I watch The Fountain ? I'm still not sure if there even WAS a reason.  ????-??-??T10:42:00   JA  Oh I totally LOVED it. I get both of your points, my bf wasn't as crazy about it as I was and shares your reactions, but I was just with it the whole time. Yeah, it's weird, and there were moments that I was just like WTF, but I loved that about it. I loved that it was willing to go there, like Jackman gulping fistfuls of spooge from the tree. I haven't felt this invigorated by a movie all year. I am a monster Aronofsky fan, though, so I'm a wee bit biased.

Swift said that information was of vital importance to intelligence circles yet ultimately used against the cooperative captive.

He quoted the defendant as telling him that he had returned to work for bin Laden in 2001 only because he was "caught between two fires" -- "The absolute best chance for him to rehabilitate is to reunite with that family," Swift told the jurors.

The magnitude 7.6 earthquake that struck on Oct. 8 triggered, in the words of Pakistan's prime minister, "a disaster of unprecedented proportions in Pakistan's history." In one terrible upheaval, it killed tens of thousands of people, trapped or injured thousands more, and left an estimated 2 million homeless.

CONTEXT	 That's the real disease... Among those stoking up the swine flu hysteria last week was Professor Neil Ferguson of the World Health Organisation, whose computer model predicts that the killer virus could strike down “four in 10 Britons”. At the time of the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, it may be noted, Prof Ferguson was part of Prof Roy Anderson’s Imperial College team whose computer modelling was responsible for the “pre-emptive cull” that resulted in killing some eight million perfectly healthy animals not directly exposed to infection. As many lawyers pointed out, this mass slaughter was illegal. The loudest health warnings, it seems, should be reserved for any policy based on a computer model.

A commenter on the linked Reuters story says, "That was no joke – especially when you look at the actual video. Mike Huckabee was talking to the National Rifle Association, to a group of gun-owners and gun-lovers, that may well include racists and haters. He did not crack a smile; it flowed right in with his speech. That was instigation to violence: a casual instillation of the idea for the assassination of a presumed presidential nominee of the United States. He should be arrested and charged. In an airport security line, if an ordinary citizen deadpan some "joke" about guns and noise, the person would no doubt be hauled off and investigated. We should do no less to this dangerous demagogue."

CONTEXT	 2009-07-01T00:00:00     The above is Dan Savage's translation of the Fort Worth Police Chief Jeff Halstead's defense of his officers in the beating of Chad Gibson during a raid of the Rainbow Lounge on Saturday.  Halstead: "You're touched and advanced in certain ways by people inside the bar, that's offensive. I'm happy with the restraint used when they were contacted like that." Dan continues : All of this is bullshit. I 've been in a million gay bars. I've been in gay bars on multiple occasions when the police came in to check everyone's IDs and make sure no minors were being served. Gay men don't grope police officers when they enter gay bars. I find it inconceivable that the gay men drinking in the Rainbow Lounge in Fort Worth responded to a raid by attempting to grope the police officers. This "they groped us!" shit is a lie. As the owner of the bar, J.R. Schrock, put it at the protest the night after the raid: "The groping of the police officer—really? We're gay, but we're not dumb," Schrock said to the crowd that gathered at the bar Sunday afternoon. "That is a lie, and I am appalled by it." Jeff Halstead can't be allowed to use the Gay Panic Defense. His officers weren't groped, no one was "touched and advanced." Homophobic cops raided a gay bar, roughed up the patrons, and a young man is in the hospital and may die. Some will say that this was just an ill-timed raid on a gay bar in Texas, of all places, one that got out of control. So what's the big deal? But this is exactly the kind of state-sponsored violence that gays and lesbians fought back against at Stonewall 40 years ago. Gay men all over the country are going to have to speak up and defend the patrons of the Rainbow Lounge. We can't allow the chief of police in Fort Worth to use the Gay Panic Defense or exploit stereotypes about gay men—so sexually reckless that they can't even keep their hands off cops during a raid!—to get away with violating the civil rights of gay men in Fort Worth or murdering Chad Gibson. At this writing, Chad Gibson remains in intensive care with a blood clot in his brain. Labels: "celibacy" , Dan Savage , Fort Worth , gay bashing , police brutality , Texas New!

The studio's first project is the new Robert Redford movie "Lions for Lambs" (out November 9, 2007) starring Redford, Cruise and Meryl Streep which was filmed earlier this year on the campuses of Claremont Colleges in California.

CONTEXT	 Congress will lose one of its most ardent progressives this month when ten-term Rep. Neil Abercrombie resigns to run for governor of Hawaii. His unexpected announcement has raised the ire of fellow Democrats. Leaving his office of nearly 20 years gives him more time to campaign but immediately opens the door for criticism. U.S. Sen. Dan Inouye was first to rebuke Abercrombie, saying Hawaii was losing valuable political clout. "It leaves us a vote shy in the House at a time when major policy changes like health care reform, a war spending measure, the Akaka Bill and others are shaping up for debate and passage," Inouye said in an e-mail. Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann, Abercrombie's expected opponent in the 2010 Democratic primary, agreed. "He is leaving the state in a lurch. He has become a very influential member of Congress. I think he put a lot of people in a difficult situation, including the city," Hannemann said yesterday during an interview. Abercrombie has a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign. In addition to supporting virtually all LGBT rights issues, he opposed the invasion of Iraq, voted against the Patriot Act, and supported lifting a federal ban on stem cell research. His long tenure in the House has given him senior membership on the Armed Services Committee, where he opposed the escalation of the war in Afghanistan. It's not yet known when the special election to replace him will take place, or who the likely candidates for his seat may be.

NEW YORK -- Former EPA chief Christine Todd Whitman cannot be held liable for telling residents near the World Trade Center site that the air was safe to breathe after the 2001 terrorist attacks, a federal appeals court said < http://www.nj.com/elections >  2008-04-22T18:19:42  and debris from the fallen twin towers after Sept. 11. The plaintiffs alleged that Whitman and EPA officials acting on her behalf made statements regarding air quality that failed to report or misrepresented health risks associated with the dust from the ruined skyscrapers. They said Whitman, who also is a former New Jersey governor, should be forced to pay damages to properly clean homes, schools and businesses. A lower court judge had earlier refused to dismiss Whitman as a defendant, It said its finding was consistent with an earlier decision by the 2nd Circuit to reject a claim against Whitman and others by emergency workers who responded to the trade center site and those who cleaned it up afterward. were subject to competing considerations." The appeals court said Whitman "did face a choice between competing considerations, although not the stark choice between telling a deliberate falsehood about health risks and issuing an accurate warning about them."

CONTEXT	 SAVING BUFFALO ' S UNTOLD BEAUTY BUFFALO, N.Y. That assumption came to mind when I stepped off a plane here recently. Buffalo is home to some of the greatest American architecture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with major architects like Henry Hobson Richardson, Frederick Law Yet Buffalo is more commonly identified with the crumbling infrastructure, abandoned homes and dwindling jobs that have defined the Rust Belt for the past 50 years. And for decades its Buffalo was founded on a rich tradition of architectural experimentation. The architects who worked here were among the first to break with European traditions to create an aesthetic of At a time when oil prices and oil dependence are forcing us to rethink the wisdom of suburban and exurban living, Buffalo could eventually offer a blueprint for repairing America's other shrinking postindustrial cities. Touring Buffalo's monuments is about as close as you can get to experiencing firsthand the earliest struggles to define what an American architecture would look like. Yet it is the parade of celebrated architects who worked here as much as the city's industrial achievements that makes Buffalo a living history lesson. Daniel Burnham's 1896 Ellicott Square Building, with its mighty Italian Renaissance facade, towers over Across town, Henry Hobson Richardson built his largest commission: the 1870 Buffalo State Asylum for the Insane, composed of a pair of soaring Romanesque towers flanked by low brick pavilions. Light and air poured in through tall windows; This departure from recycled European precedents is reflected in the city's late-19th-century urban planning as well. Buffalo's original plan from the early 19th century was loosely based on Pierre Charles L'Enfant's 1791 plan for Washington, an In Buffalo he realized an even grander ambition, creating a vast network of parks and parkways that he hoped would have "a civilizing effect" on the "dangerous classes" populating the It didn't last of course.

CONTEXT	 Admittedly India, among the few major global economies that will see respectable GDP growth this year, may not see job losses quite like that being felt in the West, it has nevertheless got policymakers worried. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh earlier this week urged industry to desist from laying off people and promised to cut interest rates and levies to shore up the economy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already turned its attention to driving up growth from containing inflation, and cut key reserve ratios for banks and a short-term interest rate, signalling a bias in favour of lower rates. Yet on Friday, news about job cuts came in from different directions. L&T Infotech, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the country's largest engineering company Larsen & Toubro (L&T), is shedding up to 5% of its workforce of nearly 10,000 employees, according to market sources. NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Layoffs, firings and salary cuts are increasingly becoming all too common across India Inc, highlighting a deepening slowdown in the economy that has forced companies to take the knife to costs to protect their bottom line. From banking and finance to aviation, from manufacturing to information technology, no sector appears immune, as companies look beyond hiring freezes to job cuts, mirroring a trend across much of the developed world which has seen tens of thousands of people out of employment.

CONTEXT	 Australia's QBE lifts bid for IAG Monday it had lifted its offer for the nation's second-largest Australian-listed global insurance group QBE Insurance said general insurer, Insurance Australia Group (IAG), and declared the offer final. QBE said it will now offer 0.145 of its shares plus 0.90 Australian dollars cash for each IAG share, valuing the target company at about 8.7 billion dollars (8.3 billion US dollars) or 4.60 a share, based on QBE's closing price on Friday of 25.55. The group had previously offered 0.142 of its shares and 0.70 dollars cash for each IAG share, valuing IAG at about eight billion. "QBE considers its final proposal very fair and reasonable given IAG's declining profitability in the past three years and recent profit downgrade," QBE chief executive Frank O'Halloran said in a statement. The fresh offer represents a 24 percent premium to IAG's one- month and three- month volume weighted average price before QBE first announced its bid on April 10. QBE said IAG chairman James Strong had indicated during weekend discussions that he believes the new offer is well short of the IAG board's expectations. The insurer said it is now waiting for a formal notification from IAG on its takeover proposal following IAG's board meeting in New Zealand on Tuesday. QBE had sought the backing of IAG's board before proceeding with its offer. IAG has not challenged QBE's assertion that the two companies would make a good fit but has said the offer undervalues the company despite its recent poor performance. IAG's earnings have been affected by a series of devastating storms in Australia, a weak performance from its recently acquired UK division and a "soft" commercial insurance cycle in

CONTEXT	 2008-01-17T23:04:00   Confidential Reporter  Dateline New York.  The holding company for the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Euronext, late Thursday said it has agreed to acquire the American Stock Exchange, known as Amex, in a $260 million all-stock deal. As China Confidential predicted on January 11, NYSE Euronext also said it plans to sell Amex's lower Manhattan headquarters--a landmark building that Amex moved into in 1921. Amex members will be entitled to receive additional NYSE Euronext shares based on the net proceeds from the expected sale. Veteran Wall Street watchers expect NYSE Euronext to lose the Amex name and reposition its equities business as a junior trading platform of the New York Stock Exchange--&quot;New York Light,&quot; as one investment banker put it. The transaction is subject to approval by Amex members and customary regulatory approvals, including from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and US Department of Justice. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. That is about $100 million less than the widely anticipated selling price. The proposed combination, which has been approved by both companies' boards, will expand NYSE Euronext's scale in US options, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, structured products, and cash equities. The deal is expected to create annualized cost synergies of more than $100 million within two years from closing, including technology, data center and staff integration.

El-Banna, meanwhile, sometimes drove Abu Qatada's wife and children to the imam's hideout as a favor to al-Rawi, el-Banna's lawyers said. Al-Rawi also recruited el-Banna on the trip that ended with their arrest in Africa. El-Banna, then on welfare while working under the table, planned to manage a Gambian peanut oil plant, and the El-Banna and al-Rawi were detained at Gatwick Airport the next day, however.

Al-Rawi was also taken to Afghanistan, and several months later the two were moved to Guantanamo. Al-Rawi was freed from Guantanamo this March after his help for MI5 was disclosed, but Blair has ruled out British help for el- Banna.

CONTEXT	 The clues are there which companies are favored and which are disfavored, but they conceal it very hard because it is so crucial. I offer an example of historical proportions::: People point to Walmart and cry "anti-union". Unions enable disfavored people to live satisfactorly without addressing their disfavor. This way their family's problems are never resolved. Without the union they would have to accept the heirarchy, their own inferiority. Walmart is anti-union because they are good. They try to help people address and resolve their problems by creating an environment where there are fewer hurdles. Media ridicule and lawsuits are creations to reinforce people's belief that Walmart is evil in a subsegment of the indiustry dominated by the middle and lower classes. Low-cost disfavored Chinese labor is utilized by corporate america to maximize margins. They all do it. Only WalMart gets fingered because they are the ones who help, and those who seek to create confusion in the marketplace want to eliminate the vast middle class who have a real chance and instead stick with lower classes who may not work otherwise. So they dirty him up while allowing the others to appear clean. I also wish to note::: as the LowPriceLeader WalMart doesn't offer sales so every purchase receives credit. The middle class is being deceived. They are being misled into the disfavored, and subsequently will have no assistance from their purchases with corporate america. The coining of the term "Uncle Sam" was a clue alluding to just this::Sam Walton's WalMart is one of few saviors of the peasant class. Have you made your peace with god?

CONTEXT	 2009-03-28T00:23:00   Frugal Bachelor  My dream is pretty clear. I want to retire sometime in my 30's and spend the rest of my life travelling the world. I've posted here and also on comments on other blogs that I want to spend a few years, a few decades, seeing the planet on a motorcycle. This is a somewhat romanticized version, honestly doing so variously on buses, hitchhiking, on the back of a mule, is in a lot of ways a lot better, but I'll leave that to details. I want to spend at least a year living and working in each of my favorite countries such as Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Thailand, and of course CHINA.  The planet is so giant, there is so much stuff to do, so many amazing places to experience, and my life so short. There are so many cool people I want to meet and I want to be a citizen of the earth. I want to meet my brothers and sisters all over the planet, and see how they live. I want to meet people born in different countries on the same date I was, and see how their lives turned out. I find I'm getting less inspiration from PF Blogs these days. Everything is about getting out of debt, working in a cubicle for 40 years and finally hanging it up, to enjoy your golden years carefree. I want more than that. Much better than that. JD Roth , my favorite PF blogger, has been writing lately about the various stages of personal finance. He seems to be at somewhat of a crossroads at his life and unsure what to do next. Trent Hamm has lost all hope and these days mainly focuses on how to win the office rat race. There are a lot of cool travel bloggers out there. Hobo Traveler probably right now is my favorite blogger and is living a life very close if not exactly my dream. However, he does not write about how he finances his dream. There are lot of other bloggers in similar vein to him but very few write much about their finances and how they got to where they are. I challenge the big bloggers to write about how to finance your dream. Getting out of debt is child's play and I'm tired of reading about it. You can max out your 401(k) year after a year but if you never actually use it to do something it's no better than having tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I like the old Prudential commercials where they show anything is possible with a retirement fund. Or the old Citibank ad, "Life: the Ultimate Blank Check". You better believe it. I want to see success stories of how managing your finances carefully created a life for you that simply wouldn't be possible otherwise. I want to fly to the moon and back. Show me your dreams, and show me the way, and show me how you used money to get there. Otherwise personal finance is worthless.  2009-03-27T19:59:00   Four Pillars  Just because money isn't used for space flight doesn't mean it's worthless. It's great that you have your dreams but not everybody has the same dream you do.  2009-03-27T20:05:00   Michael Harr  Very well said. I have a friend that is doing something similar to what your goals are, but he's doing it old school. Coming back home to America and working just enough to put together money to go to his next destination. He's traveling to Thailand, India, and Australia this trip and I think he's on the India leg right now. The key to his travel is that he doesn't stay at 'normal' hotels, he's got a backpack and will invariably return home with a shaggy beard and some terrific stories. I'm married with two children, and plan to work into something like this when they've left home. As for financing it, I'll have a post on Monday to show you the way.  2009-03-27T20:57:00   Janette  Become a teacher! The international schools are in every country of the world. You can teach nine months (holidays off) and travel the rest. My husband was military and I taught. We have seen, and at time lived in, twenty two countries. We know how to be frugal in travel and have enjoyed the backroads. Our kids went with us (I know you don't have any). We now are doing the seven years of staying in one place to finance the rest of our lives (52/58 currently). It is worth it - no debt and a lovely house in Kansas. I cannot talk about it on my blog- everyone sees it as bragging. Heck- we call it living! (And have the pictures to prove it!) Go for it!  2009-03-28T05:24:00   Jim Leigh  I like this post. I agree that 'we' tend to lean heavily towards "The Ten Best Ways to (Insert Favorite Money-Saving Term" too often. However, what I believe is often unrealistic for most people is retiring before 'retirement' to pursue life-conquering goals. This is why so many articles are focused towards debt-management...so when we are able to retire, we finally have the time and we can focus our cash reserves for the things we have always wanted to do!  2009-03-28T10:16:00   Andy Hough  I'm going to go on a 5 month hike on the Appalachian Trail starting this May. I'll be posting all my expenses while hiking. That probably isn't your dream but it is a lot of people's dream. The sad thing that many people don't do it because they think they can't afford it when it is actually cheaper than staying at home. I'm hoping to start traveling more in the next few years. I have a TEFL certificate but haven't taught in over 10 years. Maybe it is time to take a refresher course and start traveling and teaching. I also agree with Stephanie - most PF blogs are the same recycled tips and how-to articles. I identify most with JD of those you mentioned. I'm somewhat successful in my career, making a good living by any standard, but feel like something is missing. That's why I read your blog and Early Retirement Extreme among others - to get a different perspective. I don't really think your "dream" is that difficult... you just have to get out of the mindset of endless stability that PF blogs promote (which has been proven flawed in the last year). Especially since you have no significant other, no children, and what I would guess is sufficient education to be entrepreneurial in many parts of the world. And a valuable passport, minimal consumption needs, etc. I'm only staying in Canada right now because I have chosen a significant other, at least for now. Ideas I've considered if I wanted a decade abroad include: Moving with currency shifts and development, i.e. living in emerging markets or non tourist but beautiful areas and leaving when there is a shift. http://chrisguillebeau.com/ I have only been subscribed a week or two so I can't speak to how much the finances are detailed, but I do *think* it is discussed. One of my dreams is stability and security, and it really conflicts with my more adventurous dreams. I seek a balance there. But I like reading blogs about travel to keep me inspired so I don't forget one dream to chase the "security" dream. You have to start somewhere. So, yeah, I want to go to the moon or travel the planet but I know that until I divest myself of debt it ain't gonna happen. And I need it to happen NOW before I "settle down." So what's the solution? I don't know but one thing is clear: I need to look carefully at how I spend money. The little things add up. So when my lease was up, I bought a good used car. That was a few years ago. I dumped my credit cards and only use debit cards so I pay as I go. And the most recent step in this direction was to get rid of my cellphone. The latest 2 year contract was up and I didn't renew. I switched to a prepaid cellphone and kept the same number. I got a Tracfone which is very good quality and service. And cheap. So...I'm chipping away at everything and that's the only way I'm going to get where I want to go.  2009-03-31T17:05:00   Fabulously Broke  I don't really have a PF dream other than to be careful with my money, not die eating cat food living in a hobo shelter covered in newspaper with my children hating me for saddling them with $200k in debt in education loans. I aim for just having a better than average, comfortable life, but I don't really need to say "I want to be a millionaire by the age of 30!" Ever thought of doing income taxes? You work 4 months. Amount of money generated should be able to sustain a touring lifestyle. How about couchsurfing.com? You can save tons with it. Drawback: weirdos.  2009-04-03T19:32:00   mdoneil  The millionaire by 40 thing is not as exciting as you think it might be. Especially if most of your 'money' is in equities. I did it because I started investing in high school (and because I bought BRK.A in the early 80s - I was a lucky kid and I paid attention to my dad.) I still go to the office every day, but I have had a fun life up until now, and in a few years when the retirement accounts top up again off I go to Mexico to start my life of leisure. FB, this is a great post. I agree that PF blogs aren't challenging enough. I've been thinking about that in the context of GRS lately, and wondering why it is I don't push more. There are a variety of reasons. First, I have a comfort zone. I know that there are certain topics that my readers like me to cover, so I tend to stick with them because they're safe. They're also easy for me to write about, so I can just be lazy. Second, the more challenging topics require that I reveal more about my own financial situation than I'm comfortable with. Because I'm not an anony-blogger, I can't share everything. But maybe I should.  2009-04-09T09:38:00   the weakonomist  I can't stand to write about normal personal finance. It's maybe 10% of my material. That being said you're a rare breed and it's naive to think your goals are anywhere near the goals of others.  2009-04-09T09:49:00   Debt Hater  I actually agree with you. I started my blog because I was deep in debt and it was stopping me from doing things I really wanted to do. Now that I'm out of debt, I don't want to blog about getting out of debt! I want to blog about my travel, buying property in NYC and starting my own biz (when I do these things). And yes, I'd love to read more about how people actually financed their dreams and desires. I want to know HOW they did it. I really don't care what people put in their 401(k) or how they laddered their CDs, not anymore anyway.  Catherine   2009-04-09T10:56:00  Enjoyed your post greatly. I think there are more people with your dream than will admit to it. Some may have had that dream but are now at a place in life where it's not really a feasible option. I admit to it but the "how" baffles me as well so any further insight you gain, please share! Maybe need to find someone(s) who have lived the dream and interview them??  camille@thefinancialwoman.com   2009-04-09T15:33:00  Frugal Bachelor, When I began my website,I promised I would not write another debt reduction blog. Lately I have been writing about investment intention (save money to travel the world possibly?) and also about what assets could be undervalued. I believe that is key to wealth creation and accumulation...taking advantage of undervalued assets, as cycles only occur a few times during adult lives. I agree that "retirement" savings is no longer the goal, but rather having the capital to live the lifestyle you choose by a targeted age, and contribute to society in a way that is meaningful to you, which would not likely be a cubicle job, at least for me. I love Janette's teaching and travel lifestyle plan. I feel I should take a cautious stance when writing about money, as everyone has different circumstances and abilities to take risk and ride out the downturns. It is so important to understand what you invest in beforehand, and know whether you could take the potential downturn. And as boring as it is, appropriate asset allocation helps make sure you can weather the storm. I think there is a nice place in the middle of the road between safety and risk, at least for me.  2009-04-10T09:28:00   Amanda  I now run a personal finance blog called DailyWorth.com (please don't delete this comment! It's not spam!) I just want you to know that I love what you say:  2009-04-10T09:34:00   Fiona  Speaking as someone who has spent her 20s travelling the world, and currently pursuing her dream of studying Chinese full-time in Beijing (completely self-funded), what I yearn for the most is when I can get back to having a stable job where I can use Chinese with benefits, the 401k, the works. The grass is always greener on the other side. I don't think that personal finance blogs being challenging or not is the real problem. I think that the real issue is thinking about how personal finance might fulfill goals for people. That is different for each person, and there will never be a personal finance blog that will directly address each dream for each person. Also, I have to agree that spending the rest of my life travelling is my idea of personal hell, and I say this as someone who loves travel. It's great for the first week or even the first month, but after bouts of travel diarrhea, missed trains, crowded sleeper buses, the experience of being illiterate over and over again, it can get pretty frustrating. Incidentally, in my contribution to PF blogs, I'm trying to live off 1000 RMB (about 147 USD) for a month on my blog http://quirkyBeijing.com I'm really shocked by all the negative comments on this post! Especially the ones that say you did it just for the controversy. I've been thinking this myself lately. I'm starting to move towards reading more personal development type stuff because of it. PF blogs don't write about how to manage all the things you want out of life, but development blogs sometimes do. One of the reasons that you won't find this kind of writing on PF blogs is that you often have to go off the beaten path to reach your dreams. You can't always make the 'smartest' decision, sometimes you just have to make the right ones.  2009-04-13T21:37:00   Brenda  Here is some adventure for you! My husband and I were on the "Hamster Wheel". We both had our own businesses in CA. We had a house, a dog and two kids. We worked very hard. When the real estate took a dive, people started cutting back and staying home..we saw what was comming. We decided to make a bold move. Our friends and family thought we were crazy. We sold almost everything we owned and bought a fifth wheel. We have traveled accross the United States and we are currently in Texas. We love this frugal living. Someday we will buy some land but in the meantime we are traveling and working and saving for our next trip. The great thing about a 5th wheel is there are a lot of places you can stay for free. Rent is so cheap. I wish I would have done this when I was in my 20's instead of trying to impress my friends.:) None of that matters now. I know who my real friends are. I hope you get to fulfill your dream!! www.rickbrenjessicajason.blogspot.com Hello !.  2009-12-12T13:03:00  You may , probably curious to know how one can manage to receive high yields . There is no need to invest much at first. You may begin to get income with as small sum of money as 20-100 dollars.  2010-03-11T02:15:00   Anonymous  The effects are gradual and the result will vary for each user. However, further review show that most users experience benefits within the first week.

According to experts with whom I have spoken, Bush's approach is like hunting for the proverbial needle in the haystack. As sophisticated as NSA's data mining equipment may be, it cannot, for example, crack codes it does not recognize. So the terrorist communicating in code may escape detection, even if data mining does reach him. "In short, Bush is hoping to get lucky. Such a gamble seems a slim pretext for acting in such blatant violation of Congress' law. In acting here without Congressional approval, Bush has underlined that his Presidency is unchecked - in his and his attorneys' view, utterly beyond the law. Now that he has turned the truly awesome powers of the NSA on Americans, what asserted powers will Bush use next? And when - if ever - will we - and Congress -- discover that he is using them?"

The Greek government, which has a 28-percent stake in OTE, is expected to sell a three-percent share to DT for 442.3 million euros (685 million dollars), Economy Minister George Alogoskoufis told a press conference. Vassilis Kararizos, an analyst with the financial group Proton Securities, said the tie-up with DT was unlikely to lead to major personnel changes at OTE, notably after the voluntary departure of 6,000 employees two years ago.

CONTEXT	 Head of Australia's IAG quits after QBE takeover rejected The chief executive of general insurer Insurance Australia Group (IAG) resigned Monday amid shareholder anger after the company rejected a 8.7 billion dollar (8.36 billion US) takeover bid. IAG last week said it could not recommend QBE's improved offer because it was "priced opportunistically" to take advantage of the short-term weakness in IAG's share price. One of IAG's biggest shareholders, fund manager 452 Capital, Sunday criticised the company over the failed QBE deal.

CONTEXT	 But back in 2003 , there was an interesting vote in Congress, in which both House and Senate voted to end the travel ban on all Americans, and then the conference committee reconciled the &quot;differences&quot; between the bills by striking that provision, on which both bodies agreed, altogether. Here's the Senate vote on that bill, which was on a vote to table so that a &quot;Nay&quot; vote was a vote to end the travel ban - Hillary Clinton voted &quot;nay,&quot; meaning that at that time, she was in favor of an end to the travel ban, no preconditions of changes in Cuba required. It's interesting to see which Democrats voted the other way (i.e., for the travel ban) - Corzine from Cuban-heavy New Jersey and Graham and Nelson from Cuban-heavy Florida, then Democrat-in-Name-Only (and now no longer Democrat) Joe Lieberman, and current Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid. Barack Obama, of course, wasn't in the Senate in 2003, so his opinion isn't recorded. Incidentally, the reason that travel ban was ostensibly removed in conference committee was the threat of a veto of the bill by George Bush. Considering that a majority of both houses of Congress have expressed their strong support for an end to the travel ban, a very easy position for both Obama and Clinton to take would be to promise not to veto such a bill if passed again. Neither has done so. Nor, by the way, have the Democrats even brought up the bill again since they took control of Congress. Update: Reading Fidel Castro's latest column , I discover that Clinton isn't alone in flip-flopping on Cuba. David Brooks' latest column, quoted by Fidel, informs us that &quot;Barack Obama...as candidate for Senate in 2003, was in favor of lifting the embargo.&quot; Then again, Obama used to be in support of the Palestinian people as well, as least more than the &quot;average&quot; U.S. politician. The closer they get to power, the further to the right they move.

If only Halliburton were in the health-care business. And here's the latest addition to that list: &quot;An estimated 388 million people will die from chronic disease worldwide over the next 10 years, according to World Health Organisation figures,&quot; with many of those 39 million deaths a year attributable to preventable causes such as obesity (the focus of this particular study). &quot;Insufficient physical exercise is a risk factor in many chronic diseases and is estimated to cause 1.9 million deaths worldwide each year.&quot; Remarkably, the study predicts that &quot;obesity could shorten the average lifespan of an entire generation, resulting in the first reversal in life expectancy since data collecting began in 1900.&quot;

CONTEXT	 US Envoy Writes of Israeli Threats March 31, 2009 "I was the target of an assassination attempt by terrorists using automatic rifles and antitank weapons that had been made in the United States and shipped to Israel," he wrote. "Weapons financed and given by the United States to Israel were used in an attempt to kill an American diplomat!" After the event, conspiracy theories abounded in the Middle East about who could have planned the attack, and why. Lebanon was a dangerously factionalized country. "I know as surely as I know anything that Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, was somehow involved in the attack," Dean wrote, describing how he had been under sharp criticism from Israeli politicians and media for his contacts with Palestinians. "Undoubtedly using a proxy, our ally Israel had tried to kill me." In the wake of the accusation by Chas Freeman that his nomination to lead the National Intelligence Council was derailed by an "Israeli lobby," a forthcoming memoir by another distinguished ambassador adds stunning new charges to the debate. The ambassador, John Gunther Dean, writes that over the years he not only came under pressure from pro-Israeli groups and officials in Washington but also was the target of an Israeli-inspired assassination attempt in 1980 in Lebanon, where he had opened links to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Dean's suspicions that Israeli agents may have also been involved in the mysterious plane crash in 1988 that killed Pakistan's president, General Mohammed Zia ul Haq, led finally to a decision in Washington to declare him mentally unfit, which forced his resignation from the foreign service after a thirty-year career. After he left public service, he was rehabilitated by the State Department, given a distinguished service medal and eventually encouraged to write his memoirs. Now 82, Dean sees the subsequent positive attention he has received as proof that the insanity charge (he calls it Stalinist) was phony, a supposition later confirmed by a former head of the department's medical service. It was in the midst of this Soviet endgame in Afghanistan that Dean fell afoul of the State Department for the last time. After the death of General Zia in August 1988, in a plane crash that also killed the American ambassador in Pakistan, Arnold Raphel, Dean was told in New Delhi by high-ranking officials that Mossad was a possible instigator of the accident, in which the plane's pilot and co-pilot were apparently disabled or otherwise lost control. There was also some suspicion that elements of India's Research and Analysis Wing, its equivalent of the CIA, may have played a part. India and Israel were alarmed by Pakistan's work on a nuclear weapon--the "Islamic bomb."

In Fulton, cities from Alpharetta and Roswell on the north side to Union City and College Park on the south side have sirens - but the county itself doesn't. In the wake of last weekend's storms, the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management Agency will look more closely at whether sirens are needed, Director Rocky Moore said this week.

CONTEXT	 In his fourth Rambo film, a series about a heroic American veteran of the Vietnam war, Stallone's character goes to Burma to rescue Christian aid workers from a group of brutal Burmese soldiers who kidnapped them. Burma has banned the film, and police in Rangoon have given strict orders to shops not to sell pirated copies of the movie. Stallone, who stars in, directs and co-wrote the movie, recently told reporters he hopes the film will provoke a confrontation. The actor said he is willing to travel to Burma to confront ruling military officials, or to debate them in Washington at a Congressional hearing. The Burma Campaign UK reports: Since an army coup overthrew Burma's last democratically-elected government in 1962, military-run or dominated regimes in Burma have been among the world's worst violators of human rights. An already serious level of abuses climbed higher after the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) (renamed the State Peace and Development Council in November 1997) seized power in September 1988. The junta removed all pretence of civilian administration and marked its arrival by massacring thousands of unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators in Rangoon and other Burmese cities and towns. Today, says Amnesty International, &quot;torture has become an institution&quot; in Burma. Reports by the United Nations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and other groups have repeatedly detailed a gruesome litany of abuses, including murder, torture, rape, detention without trial, massive forced relocations, and forced labor Even before 1988, Burma's army faced allegations of serious human rights abuses, especially in its campaigns against ethnic groups along the country's borders. These severe violations continue today, including arbitrary executions and forced labor of villagers as military porters in combat zones. Children have been particularly hard hit, both as direct physical victims of military abuse and as members of affected families. In 2001, conditions in Shan State and Karen State deteriorated as the junta launched wide-scale military operations. Hundreds of thousands of people in those areas have fled their homes to avoid conscription as porters or worse abuses. While some have reached safety in Thailand, most remain internally-displaced persons (IDPs). Only a few who are near the Thai frontier receive even a little external food or medical assistance.

New Line will now be folded into Warner Bros. Here is the email that was just sent out to all staffers: "February 28, 2008 To: New Line Colleagues From: Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne Subject: Our Company This afternoon, Time Warner is announcing that New Line will become a unit of Warner Bros. This is, of course, a very difficult and emotional time for all of us who have worked at New Line. While there read about it in the press. New Line will maintain its own identity and will continue to produce, market, and distribute movies. But New Line will now do so as part of Warner Bros. and will probably be a much smaller operation than in the past. Time Warner hopes that operating New Line as a unit of Warner Bros. will allow New Line to focus on the creative side of movie- making, while reducing costs and taking advantage of Warner Bros.' distribution systems. The company will be holding group meeting with New Line employees tomorrow in Los Angeles and New York to discuss this announcement, and is committed to letting employees know as soon as possible about how this change affects them individually. For our part, we will be stepping down as Co-Chairmen and Co-CEOS of New Line. This was a painful decision, because we love New Line and the people who work here have been like our second families. But we will be leaving the company with enormous pride in what all of us at New Line have accomplished together. From its humble beginnings 40 years ago, our studio has created some of the most popular and successful movies of all time. Those movies are a tribute to the amazing creative energy and entrepreneurial abilities of the talented people at New Line. They are a legacy that will endure forever. Although we are stepping out of New Line, we intend to remain actively you advised of developments. We thank all of you who have worked so hard to make New Line such a success. We are very proud of every one of you.  Newsreading.F...@gmail.com   2008-02-28T18:36:00

Johnson also declined to run for a second term (in a move that was probably more surprising than Fidel's decision today), and I doubt you'll find a single reference to him &quot;resigning&quot; the Presidency. Goodman made a second error during the program which is also quite common. Describing the positions of the two Democratic Presidential candidates, she noted that Obama is for removing travel restrictions on Cuban-Americans (but not on other Americans) to Cuba, and then claimed that Clinton had the &quot;politically expedient&quot; position of maintaining the status quo so that she &quot;wouldn't lose a single Cuban-American vote.&quot; But that's exactly backwards, because the majority of Cuban-Americans support the removal of travel restrictions (and remittance restrictions) on themselves, which is precisely the Obama position. So, whether or not he adopted the position out of political expediency, about which I have no evidence, objectively speaking it is Obama who has the &quot;politically expedient&quot; position, not Clinton.
