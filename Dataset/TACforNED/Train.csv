CONTEXT	Now, in fact, it's hard to think of Los Angeles without thinking  of the music of the Eagles, and it's impossible to consider the band without Los Angeles as a frame. The L.A. story of the Eagles is on the first page of the final chapter. The band has a new album in stores for the first time in 28 years, and the members seem to know their own swan song when they hear it. "It was painful birth," lead guitarist Joe Walsh said of the struggle to finish "Long Road Out of Eden," which ended up as a double  album. "I can't think we have another one in us. I really When the new edition of the Billboard 200 chart is released Wednesday  , it will show that the No. 1 album in America is "Blackout" from Britney Spears.    In reality, the best-selling album in the United States  over the past week was  "Eden" -- but because it was sold exclusively through Wal-Mart stores and the veteran band's Web site, "Eden" is ineligible for the Billboard The first Eagles album since the Carter administration has a first-week total that looks to be about 700,000 copies, according to the band's manager, Irving Azoff . That doubles the sales of the new Spears album and makes "Eden" one of the fastest-selling CDs of the year, even though it was not released by anything resembling a traditional record label. "I'm not even sure what the recording industry is anymore," said Don Henley, who with Glenn Frey is the most familiar voice in the Eagles. To add to the sense of strangeness, the   band finds its new music  getting its most significant radio airplay at country stations. Embracing that, the Eagles will perform Wednesday   on the Country Music Association Awards on ABC , which, shockingly, will mark the first time the band has  appeared on an awards "Eden" is an epic album (many critics, in fact,  say  it's too long, although the reviews largely have  been  positive) and all four members -- Henley, Frey, Walsh and bassist Timothy B. Schmit -- get a turn in the spotlight. It's almost like they are taking their bows. The 20th and final song on "Eden" is a farewell tune, "Your World Now." "It's a sort of a passing-of-the-torch song, it's an adios song," Henley said. "It works on that level for our children and also on the band level." A few weeks ago, the Eagles were back at the Troubadour to sit down for an interview with "60 Minutes." Frey found the experience  heartwarming -- and  somewhat claustrophobic. "It was like walking up to a house you used to live in and knocking on the door -- `Do you mind if I came in and looked around?' " Frey said. "The place seemed so big to me once, and they are really so small. I don't know what made the Troubadour apartment upstairs from a young songwriter named Jackson Browne. Frey had come west from Detroit and was living in a shabby Frey would hitchhike to West Hollywood to soak in the pulsing scene at the Troubadour even though he was so broke he sometimes nursed one beer all night. Another young singer on  the scene was Henley, fresh from Texas. Henley and Frey became roommates and part of Linda Ronstadt's band, along with Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner. The four then went their own way, called themselves the Eagles and signed to a start-up label called Elektra Records. The label was run by a young manager named David Geffen. They didn't have to wait long for fame. Their first album, " Eagles," yielded three hit singles: "Take It Easy," "Witchy Woman " and "Peaceful Easy Feeling." Their second album was the 1973 Old West concept album "Desperado." "We didn't have any hits on the second album," Henley said. "We made sure of that. We were afraid of The years would disabuse the band of that notion. The next three albums -- "On the Border," "One of These Nights" and "Hotel California" -- moved away from country twang and toward a dusty, Western sort of rock with more guitar sinew. A lot of that came from  the addition of guitarist Don Felder in 1974  and then Walsh in  1976 . These changes were not made gently. Leadon, frustrated with the rock direction, announced his resignation by pouring a beer over Frey's head. Bass player Meisner, sick of the chaos, left in 1977. The Eagles recruited Schmit, who was stunned by the backstage strife. "I thought at first it was just the normal tensions, you know, but these were really intense," Schmit said. "And then came that night in Long Beach." The "Long Night in Wrong Beach," July 31, 1980, found the Eagles muttering dark threats to each other between  choruses. After the show, there was a brawl backstage. Schmit watched it all in shock. "I remember after weeks it sank in: This really was the end of it all." The band members went their  separate ways,  but they came back together for the kids. The fan appetite and the big money it represented led to a 1994 reunion with a delicious name: the Hell Freezes Over Tour. The group was Henley, Frey, Walsh, Felder and Schmit, and they broke  records. A concert album (along with a few new studio tracks) sold  8.5 million copies, and in 1998 the Eagles  were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band circled the world twice on tour, but there wasn't a lot of warmth backstage. The five members played together for the last time  on New Year's Eve 1999 in Los Angeles. A few weeks later, the band fired Felder, and lawsuits followed. Felder claimed Henley and Frey wanted to  hoard the band's money. The two founding members countered that band chemistry would improve without Felder. (There was a settlement, but legal subplots remain.) The Felder affair reinforced the nagging image of the band  as a sour, mercenary collective. One way to measure the ubiquity of the Eagles is to gauge the bile they inspire. Punk rock was, to many observers, a direct response to the Eagles , and hating the Eagles even made it to theaters as a recurring gag in "The Big Lebowski." The new deal with Wal-Mart brought hectoring. Henley said the impetus for the deal was the environmental initiatives by the world's largest private employer, but Frey said it was simple math: "If this is our last album, I wanted to sell as many The band members stopped listening to their detractors years ago, but even they said they were ready to retire the franchise at the start of this decade. "The old songs are part of the cultural lexicon and they have been good to us, but at some point singing them over and over just isn't any fun," Henley said. In summer  2001, the band was in Europe on tour when a funny thing happened. With Felder out of the picture, the band found it was acting like, well, a band again. "We didn't just play, we started hanging out again," Frey said. "It was a pleasure to go to sound check. There was a lot of fun and lot of laughs on the charter flights from country to country. " Steuart Smith , Felder's replacement, became "a catalyst, a source of rejuvenation for us,"  Henley said.  The band decided to go into the studio and chose a fateful date:    Sept. 11, 2001. World events seeped through the studio walls. One of the first pieces of music they worked on was an extended jam that coiled with ominous power. "I remember thinking: We're never going to write the lyrics to this thing, it's just too long and too scary," Frey said. But Henley, who had written the epic Eagles song "The Last Resort," responded with another "magnum opus," as Frey called it. That forlorn rumination on the Middle East and geopolitics became the title track of the new album, even though much of the CD is relationship songs and honeyed harmonies. In fact, the album "We were done with the album a few times," Walsh said, "but it wasn't done with us." Maybe so, but the famously dour Henley frets that the album should have been leaner. "I think there are only a couple of superfluous things on there." To elaborate, he said,  "would break the band up. Again." The most likely thing to break up the Eagles is time, distance (Henley lives in Dallas, the others in different parts of California) and the tug of family. Last summer, when Henley  was the first Eagle to turn 60,  he celebrated by surfing in Malibu with his 9-year-old son and pal Jimmy Buffett. Smiling as he recounted the experience, Henley "This is the final statement .  We got back together and went around the world twice on tour, but then there was nothing left to do without new music. Now we have this album that fits in with our body of  work. There won't be another Eagles album after this. That's what I think today." Long, Hard Road Leads Eagles to `Eden' covers just about every Eagles musical territory.

CONTEXT	 And the RFU made it clear that the former double British and Irish Lions captain would be in full control of the side. RugbyU: Johnson appointed England manager by Julian Guyer Martin Johnson was named on Wednesday as the new manager of the England team from July 1 following a meeting of the management board of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) here at Twickenham.The 38 -year-old effectively replaced Brian Ashton as head coach as one The 2003 World Cup winning captain's contract runs until December 31, 2011 - after the end of the next World Cup in New Zealand earlier that year. The management board said it had "considered and unanimously approved" the report and recommendations of RFU elite rugby director Rob Andrew, on "strengthening the England team Only last week RFU chief executive Francis Baron said he hoped the 61-year-old Ashton could remain in the post and work with the new manager.

Ashton has been offered the post of head of England's national academy, a position he held before taking over as England coach. "I am passionate about the England team and delivering success for it." forwards coach John Wells, an old club-mate of the former However, like Ashton, Johnson has inherited his backroom staff in Leicester lock, and defence specialist Mike Ford. before last year's Six Nations following the unsuccessful reign Ashton won 12 of his 22 Tests in charge after being appointed of Andy Robinson. His time in charge saw England, against most predictions, reach last year's World Cup final, where they lost to South Africa, and also finish second in this year's Six Nations - their best placing in the tournament since their 2003 Grand Slam. But after the World Cup ex-England captain Lawrence Dallaglio said the players had to plead with Ashton to get a grip on the side following the team's record 36-0 Pool defeat by South This year's Six Nations also saw England lose to Wales, after a naive second- half display and go down to Scotland in a dire match. As a player Johnson was renowned for his ability to read a game and tell his players what they needed to do to win when in a losing position. But he was backed to succeed by Rory Underwood, England's record try-scorer with 49 from 85 Tests. "He's not one for making huge long speeches but he gives out very clear messages," Underwood, a former Leicester, England and Lions team-mate of Johnson's told Sky Sports. "He was not just a captain who worries about what the forwards do. He will worry about the whole game and is knowledgeable about the game." And following Andrew's review of the Six Nations, when he was tasked by the RFU with finding a manager, it was clear Ashton was on borrowed time. Andrew, in the first public acknowledgment of Ashton's skills by the RFU since the Six Nations, said: "I would like to thank Brian for the job he has done in difficult circumstances. have offered him as head coach of the National Academy is ideally role in the new senior structure, I believe the new post that we suited to his special talents and expertise." Johnson, Andrew and Baron are not expected to make any further comment on the situation until they hold a news conference at Twickenham on Friday.

The airport is a growing conduit of tourism and allows the territory to play a diplomatic role in relations between Taiwan and the mainland. Since late last year, a start-up airline has begun flights linking Taipei with Beijing via the new airport, where its planes make a token landing and switch flight numbers while the passengers stay aboard. Until Air Macau began its service, a yearly stream of 2 million Taiwanese business people had to pass through Hong Kong or another country and change aircraft before entering the mainland.

The airport also makes up for the loss of gamblers and visitors from Hong Kong, whose economy has slowed recently and whose residents have been saving more as a hedge against any fallout of China's takeover The airport isn't the only investment Macau has made in its economic future in recent years. Three years ago, the government supported the construction of a container port on the northeast side of Coloane The casinos, the airport and the new manufacturers give mainland China a significant stake in the economic future of Macau and have led many experts to predict the mainland won't meddle in its commercial affairs. OVERSHADOWED BY HONG KONG, MACAU TOO WILL RETURN TO CHINA MACAU From the window of his sixth-floor apartment on the Macau Peninsula, Loren Fessler has a view of mainland China's Guangdong Province. Half a mile away on the opposite shore of Macau's Inner Harbor, he can see the construction of a giant high-rise apartment building looming over a shanty town on China's Wan Chai island. China will take back Macau in December 1999 after nearly 450 years of Portuguese rule, and has every reason to leave the European outpost the way it is, Fessler says. While the world is focused on the transfer of Hong Kong to China next July 1, the handover of Macau 40 miles west of the British colony on the opposite side of the giant Pearl River delta has gone largely unnoticed. Yet Chinese leaders consider their repossession of Macau two and a half years after Hong Kong an equally significant historical event and a part of a process that they hope will eventually also include Although the handover of Macau is far less controversial than that of Hong Kong, China's past relations with the territory still stir anxiety among some about its future as a part of the mainland. The main reason people in Macau are confident about their future is China's own stake in its economy. former Time magazine correspondent who has lived in the territory for ``China gets a lot of money out of this place,'' says Fessler, a six years and is deputy editor for the Macau Express, its only English-language newspaper. Macau is an odd remnant of colonial history whose cityscape reflects its once-prosperous position as the European merchant capital of the Orient, its current role as a gambling destination and its potential In 1557, officials in Canton (now Guangzhou) agreed to rent them the Macau Peninsula on the southwest corner of the Pearl River delta 100 miles south of the prosperous Chinese city.

Macau managed to survive by offering residency to all European China traders. But Hong Kong eclipsed Macau as the regional center for trade, and in 1851 the Portuguese government had to switch gears again. This time, it legalized gambling to stay financially afloat. Since then, Macau has become a mini-Las Vegas and has shared the proceeds with the Chinese government. Although it also has fireworks, textiles, garment and electronics manufacturers, Macau's 10 casinos reclaimed land on the peninsula's east side. To further accommodate apartment buildings are going up next to the colonial villas and on its growth, the Macau government has linked the peninsula by bridges with Taipa and Coloane, the territory's two islands south of the peninsula. Macau, whose land mass is less than 2 percent of Hong Kong's, entertains 6 million visitors a year, or more than 14 times the local, predominantly ethnic Chinese population of about 425,000. This way, Macau officials hope they can snatch a third of the lucrative $2 billion Taiwan-China transit/tourist market now dominated by Hong Kong and draw several hundred million dollars in new income next year, said Gabriela Cesar, director of Macau's Economic Services. But what of Macau's political future? Like Hong Kong, Macau will become a special administrative region of China and be given a high degree of autonomy for at least 50 years after 1999. independence after the Portuguese revolution in the 1970s, regards The Lisbon government, which granted its remaining colonies Macau as a piece of Chinese land under Portuguese administration instead of a colony like Hong Kong. determined to put a last-minute stamp of western civil rights on the And unlike Hong Kong, which has an outgoing British governor colony, Macau lacks a strong political opposition and a recalcitrant government. ``There is no independence movement on Macau,'' Fessler says. ``Relations between China and Portugal have generally been very friendly.'' That doesn't mean everyone in Macau will receive the Chinese with open arms. Many in Macau still remember how the excesses of China's Cultural Revolution spilled over into the territory. In 1966, Red Guards stormed Macau and clashed with Portuguese troops until the territory's government offered to simply hand over Macau to Beijing. The Chinese backed off for fear of losing its foreign trade. In 1989, shortly before tanks started rolling over pro-democracy students on Beijing's Tiananmen Square, a pro-democracy rally in Macau drew 100,000 participants, or nearly a quarter of the entire population. China's takeover of Macau is still more than three years off, but the territory's residents haven't voted against the mainland with their feet so far. About half the territory's people have a Portuguese passport or could get one and leave, Cesar said. Since 1990, however, Macau's population has grown by 25 percent from 339,500 to the current 425,000, she said. ``People in Macau are waiting to see what happens in Hong Kong,'' Cesar said. ``It will be a test.''

The pipeline is expected to start in Asalouyeh, Iran, pass through Baluchistan and Sind in Pakistan, then reach India, which would receive 5 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually.

In addition, many private insurance plans base payments for prescription drugs on the same price list that Abbott supplies to the government. The Justice Department is investigating whether more than 20 drug companies, including Abbott, inflated prices paid by Medicare and Medicaid. Abbott has said it also is a target of pricing investigations in five states, including Illinois.

CONTEXT	 The Hawthorn Hawks took advantage of a poor kicking performance by defending champion Geelong to upset the Cats 18.7 (115) to 11.23 (89) Saturday in the Australian Rules football grand final. Before a crowd of 100,012 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground -- the biggest attendance at a grand final since 1986 -- and in warmer than usual spring temperatures of about 28 Celsius (82 Fahrenheit), the Cats, who lost just one of 22 regular-season matches, held a 33-32 lead at the end of the first quarter Saturday. The Hawks outscored the Cats six goals to three in the third period and four goals to two in the fourth. The Cats went into the match having won 42 of their past 44 games, while the Hawks posted the second-best 17-5 record in the regular season. Hawthorn and Geelong last met in a grand final in 1989, when the Hawks won back-to-back titles by beating the Cats. The last time the teams met -- in the 17th round this season -- Geelong eked out an 11-point victory in a close match in which the Hawks missed several late shots at goals. The Cats are from a mostly industrial port city about an hour's drive southwest of Melbourne and Hawthorn is an affluent inner- city Melbourne suburb. Mark Williams kicked three goals for the winners, while Stuart Dew, Cyril Rioli and Lance Franklin had two each. Luke Hodge of Hawthorn won the North Smith Medal for being the best player on the field in the final. Hodge suffered a rib injury in a heavy clash in last weekend's preliminary final win over St. Kilda and spent time off the field Saturday after sustaining a new injury during the second quarter. The win gave Hawks veteran Shane Crawford a league title in his 305th game.

Chukwu, who is currently the technical adviser of local club Rangers International, said though the Eagles have not done badly in the first qualifying round, they still need to improve on their game if they want to play in the World Cup in South Africa. He said he was happy that the team's defense is rock solid as they conceded only one goal so far - an own goal from Joseph Yobo. Chukwu, who captained the 1980 Nations Cup winning team, also called on the players to be more committed. Former Nigerian goalkeeper trainer Joseph Erico also warned the team against complacence. "The Eagles have to buckle their shoes and fasten their belts as the challenges ahead will be tougher," he said. "They should be consistent in their outings, as this is the only thing that can make them make a headway in the last round of the qualifiers, I know that the Eagles will do better when they come back for the qualifying series," he added.

CONTEXT	For the past four years the former whalers have joined New  Zealand's Department of Conservation in two-week-long surveys in early winter to count humpback whales migrating northwards through New Zealand waters. Department of Conservation marine biologist Nadine Gibbs, who is in charge of the humpback survey, agrees the former whalers still have what it takes. The hunters are now protectors but the instincts of the former whalers are as sharp as ever as they scan the wild waters of New Zealand's Cook Strait. Perched high on a clifftop overlooking the stretch of sea dividing New Zealand's South and North Islands, the four men -- Joe Heberley, Tommy Norton, Johnny Norton and Peter Perano -- press their eyes to their binoculars as they scour the horizon for the telltale spout of a surfacing whale. To the east of their open-fronted tent is the entrance from the strait to Tory Channel. On the opposite headland across the channel is the hilltop whaling lookout they manned nearly half a In those days, a cry of "Thar she blows!" would set off a mad scramble down the hill to sleek chaser boats, which would pursue the whales -- almost always humpbacks -- with harpoons and deadly By the fifth day of this year's survey, the former whalers have already seen 15 humpbacks, more than the total spotted during the 2006 fortnight. They have also spotted a rare southern right whale, a species hunted to the brink of extinction in New Zealand by the mid-19th century. Although now in their 60s and 70s, the four men have lost none of the competitiveness from five decades earlier when being the first to spot a whale would mean a hefty bonus. "The only thing that has changed is the colour of our hair," says Heberley, still buoyant after earlier spotting the right whale. Then as now, a new notch is carved into the wooden chair of the first man to spot a whale. The men look back to their days with the Perano family-owned firm as the best days of their lives. "It was the most exciting job I ever had," says Norton. "We got a real buzz out of it." Part of the buzz was the danger, hunting humpbacks up to 16 metres (50 feet) long and weighing as much as 36 tonnes in Cook Strait, famous for its wild seas and winds. But there were days when no whales appeared and the young men dreamed up some unusual ways of keeping boredom at bay. One of the whalers introduced stilts to the lookout, where they would totter along the narrow ridge surrounded by plunging cliffs. loved by pig and whalers alike during the late 1940s. Suzie Chasing and wrestling a tame wild pig named Suzie was apparently enjoyed more than her share of the men's lunches and the beer they wouldn't touch while working. Several generations of Heberleys, Nortons and Peranos have been whalers, an industry which goes back to the first days of European settlement in New Zealand in the early 19th century. fisherman Joe Perano was frightened witless by two enormous The Perano business was set up in 1911, several years after humpbacks surfacing either side of his small rowing boat, nearly knocking him into the water. The Perano humpback catch fell to 55 in 1961, then to 24 and nine in the subsequent two years. At the end of 1964, New Zealand's last whaling station closed for good. Gibbs says the number of whales seen in the last few years indicates some recovery but are still only about 29 percent of the numbers recorded at the start of the 1960s. numbers, an issue made more pressing by Japan's plans to catch 50 The study aims to fill big holes in knowledge about humpback of the marine giants under its so-called scientific whaling programme.

The visit to Goddard came three weeks after NASA signed an agreement with the British National Space Centre to hold discussions on lunar science and exploration. Some in the crowd cheered and waved small British flags. Some seemed star-struck, their mouths hanging open in awe as she passed by. As Queen Elizabeth went through the classroom, she approached another British astronaut, Piers Seller. Turning to Prince Philip and nudging him lightly, the queen said, ``He's been on a spacewalk.''

Prince Philip seemed particularly interested as Sellers stood in front of a spacesuit and explained what it was like to wear it -- and be locked into it -- for up to 10 hours. He said the suit could allow an astronaut to survive in space for up to 16 hours. Sellers discreetly explained how it was possible to spend up to 10 hours in a spacesuit without that being a problem. Sellers said later. He said the prince came back to him and asked Prince Philip ``was asking me how you stay alive in there,'' if he had ever come across any space debris. Sellers said he had seen signs of it and that a piece of debris once pierced a solar panel like a bullet. ``That's why I have the other guy walk in

In fact, she used it to her advantage. These days, she finds it less amusing. Joanne's maiden name is Johnson. She was born July 3, 1929 ("my mother and I couldn't wait") into a family that valued beauty, charm, good works and good manners. "I have dyslexia," Herring says. "But back then, they thought I was not only unattractive but dumb." Herring says her parents were very comfortable, but not like some of their neighbors, who were very rich.

"Joanne learned on the air and turned out to be quite good at what she did -- even if she was over the top most of the time." But she wasn't single long. After five dates with millionaire oilman Robert Herring, she felt she'd found a true partner, someone who valued her intelligence and business acumen as well as her beauty and social skills.

They gave it a shot, but in the end there wasn't enough fight left. "We played about as well as we could have possibly played," Florida coach Billy Donovan said. "Our problem was we had a real difficult time matching up with them." The Vols (27-3, 13-3) clinched their first outright SEC title since 1967. "This is a very special place to come win championships," UT coach Bruce Pearl said. "When you win a title like this, it isn't about your team, but about the respect you have for the assists) with 1:47 left. The Vols' Smith missed two free throws 3-pointer by freshman guard Nick Calathes (24 points, nine with 44.1 seconds left, but Tyler Smith's rebound and layup gave the Vols an 87-85 lead. The Gators got exactly what they needed in the first half. Florida shot 8-of-8 in the first six minutes of the game, and junior guard Walter Hodge (16 points) scored 11 of UF's first 16 points. "Florida could not have played better in the first 20 minutes," Pearl said. "We were down 13, which is the largest deficit we've been down in a half all season. We extended a little bit more in the second half, pressed out and they didn't get as many open shots as they did in the first half."

The relentless fast-break offense and pressing defense wore out opponents - but eventually wore out the Vols, too. Coach Bruce So this season, Pearl is intent on not letting that happen again. But he's equally intent on not altering the aggressive style of the No. 22 Volunteers (13-4 before Wednesday's game at Auburn), who came into the week leading the league in scoring at 84.5 can do that again, I wouldn't want to change a thing," Pearl "I thought, given our record in the SEC of 12-4, God bless if we said. "But we have got to gear it down at some point, and we did at the end of last year. We shortened practices, tried to keep them off their feet a little more." Last year's UT team was plenty talented but perhaps not as deep as this one, whose losses have come to No. 4 North Carolina, No. 7 Ohio State, No. 18 Butler and Vanderbilt. "We all got worn out last year," said Bradshaw, a senior whose backcourt mate Chris Lofton entered the week leading the SEC at 22.5 points a game. "There were some injuries, and myself and C.J. Watson had to play a lot of minutes. But a lot of teams get fatigued. We have to be mentally tough. We're more familiar with it this year, and the conditioning part we took more serious this guns most of the time, so the style is not going to change much. "I think we'll handle it better this year.

If you play 36 minutes one game, he'll cut it down the next day. We've Bradshaw has had games this season in which he played 35 or 36 minutes. In an ideal world, that's at least five minutes more than Pearl wants anyone to play. "I don't have a crystal ball," Pearl said. "People talk about the need to peak at the right time, but because the regular season is such a grind, if I worried about peaking at the right time, we'd selection committee will focus on, is whether you're getting "What I want to focus on, and what I think the [NCAA tournament] better throughout the season.

They got better down the stretch and didn't lose until this "We're very confident but humble about it as well," said the guard, who is second in the SEC in assist-to-turnover ratio (2.69). "We have confidence we can play with anybody, but we have to get better and lock down on defense for 40 minutes. Right now, we're doing that in spurts, and that's not good enough."

CONTEXT	US tanks and troops took control of Saddam Hussein's last power base  of Tikrit Monday signalling a swift end in sight to the Iraq war, as the coalition stepped up efforts to restore order in Baghdad. After airstrikes throughout the night, US armour poured into Tikrit, meeting resistance only on the edges of Saddam's tribal stronghold 180 kilometres (115 miles) north of Baghdad. "This morning, the attack entered Tikrit, securing the presidential palace and beginning to search for any regime supporters," he told a media briefing at US Central Command in Qatar. Tikrit was deserted of Iraqi regular troops and much of its 100,000 population, although a handful of residents emerged to catch a glimpse of the US troops. Like many of the other Iraqi cities before, Tikrit appears to have fallen with less resistance than had been expected as Saddam's 24-year grip on Iraq crumbled. US Central Command said some Saddam loyalists in Tikrit had not given up the fight, but a spokesman said the US military no longer considered the Iraqi army an effective force. Another half-brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, was killed Friday in a US air strike.

Canadian household, by the mission's end in 2011, parliamentary dollars (15.8 billion US), or about 1,500 dollars (1,309 US) per budget officer Kevin Page said in a report. "This is the first comprehensive costing of Canada's Afghanistan mission covering military operations, development aid and reconstruction costs, and the long-term costs of taking care of Military operations accounted for much of the costs, at up to 7.42 billion dollars (6.47 billion US), followed by veterans' benefits at 2.08 billion dollars (1.81 billion US), and 0.97 The study does not include the cost of diplomatic efforts, nor does it presume to "put a monetary value on the heroic efforts of brave Canadian soldiers who have given up their life in service Accelerated procurement of military equipment and danger pay for soldiers was also excluded from the final amount "due to lack of reliable data," it said. "This suggests that the estimates provided may understate the costs of Canada's mission in Afghanistan," Page said in his report. At a press conference, he underscored his use of incremental costs in the study, not full costs. "If we were to provide an estimate on a full cost basis, it would be a much larger number," To date, the Canadian government has cited a lower cost estimate for the war in Afghanistan of eight billion dollars (seven billion US). Prime Minister Stephen Harper Thursday took issue with the parliamentary budget officer's inclusion of certain costs in his But, "the parliamentary budget officer has included some very long-term costs that don't relate in our judgment to the day to day of the mission," he said. All of the monies for the mission were set aside in past budgets, he added. "When compared with international experience, Canada appears to lag behind the best practices of other jurisdictions in terms of the quality and frequency of war cost reporting to their respective legislatures," he commented. "Although Canada is in the seventh year of the mission, Liberal leader Stephane Dion responded to the report by accusing Harper of "false transparency."

India's government on Thursday hailed U.S. congressional approval of a civilian nuclear pact between the two nations, calling it a "monumental achievement," and an official said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would visit New Delhi soon to sign the accord. The U.S. Senate on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly in favor of overturning a three-decade ban on atomic trade with India, allowing American businesses to begin selling nuclear fuel, technology and reactors in exchange for safeguards and U.N. inspections of India's civilian nuclear plants. The U.S. House of Representatives earlier approved the accord, which now goes to President George W. Bush, a consistent supporter of the deal. Rice was expected to arrive in New Delhi on Saturday, the Press Trust of India news agency reported, but there was no official confirmation yet. Bush hailed the Senate's passage of legislation approving the accord, saying it would "strengthen our global nuclear nonproliferation efforts, protect the environment, create jobs Singh was not immediately available for comment Thursday because he was attending ceremonies marking the birthday of Indian pacifist leader Mohandas Gandhi.

He could not say when that would happen. India imports about 75 percent of its oil, and Singh, the architect of India's 1991 transformation from a socialist to a capitalist-style economy, has argued the country needs the nuclear deal to power its financial growth and lift its citizens out of poverty. India has faced a shortage of enriched uranium and the accord will help it obtain fuel for its 22 civilian nuclear reactors that currently operate at less than 50 percent capacity, said K. Subrahmanyam, a defense expert and former member of India's National Security Council. Indian National Security Adviser M. K. Narayanan said the world has now recognized India as a nuclear power.

We are now a recognized nuclear power," Narayanan and assist India in meeting its growing energy needs in a responsible manner." India has refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and has been subject to a nuclear trade ban since its first atomic test in 1974. Its most recent nuclear test blast was in 1998.

The announcement followed the release in Iraq of an Iranian diplomat detained in Baghdad in February, prompting the British press to raise the specter of a ``secret deal.'' British officials said the events were unconnected. Speculation about how the diplomatic standoff was resolved centered on outside parties such as Syria, Turkey, Qatar and Iraq. But it also included theories that pragmatists such as negotiator, may have convinced the hard-line Revolutionary Guard Larijani, whose duties include being Iran's chief nuclear that the costs of a trial for the 14 men and one woman would be too high. Whatever the scenario, Ahmadinejad could boast Wednesday that he had outwitted Britain, the nation that, in his view of history, has been humiliating Iran for centuries. He said no concessions had been offered by the British government in exchange for the release but contended that British officials had assured Iran there would be no future incursions into Iranian A British Foreign Office spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he ``certainly could not confirm'' that Britain offered any pledge not to ``repeat'' the incident.

He keeps the service short, to about 30 minutes. He knows from years of practice that "It is sad," Rodrigues said. "The fervor of the people has now diminished." In Macau, the birthplace of Catholicism in China and East Asia, the ornate beauty of the centuries-old churches bears testament to its past. During the Ming Dynasty, Mateo Ricci, an Italian spread Christianity to China, Japan and Korea, Catholicism in the settlement here on the China coast, bringing missionaries who place the Portuguese called "City of the Name of God" is in crisis.

The decline is also affecting the priesthood. The average age of a priest in the Macau Diocese is over 60. No priest has been ordained by the diocese in 15 years. Still, the churches here are plentiful. There are 28 chapels and churches in the 11.5 square miles of this semiautonomous region of China, which was vacated by Portugal in 1999. and unlike the churches, the casinos are full and quickly growing the glitzy casinos. Today there are as many casinos as churches, in number. The MGM Grand, the latest of many new huge gaming complexes, opened on the waterfront last week. Rodrigues, a jovial priest who has a taste for an occasional fine glass of whiskey against doctor's orders and admits to having made the odd wager himself in earlier days, said the casinos were both a blessing and a bane. "In Macau, we were not prepared for this avalanche of money coming in," he said, adding, "After all, the state and the casinos give us all the benefits we have here, and we forget It was suppressed during the Cultural Revolution.

Dominic Yung, the director of social communication for the Hong Kong Diocese, said having a "very outspoken" cardinal undoubtedly helped recruitment. Bishop Jose Lai of Macau, the second Chinese cleric to hold the post, is far more reticent about politics. A day before thousands of Macanese marched in protest this month over government inaction on To find priests, Lai said he had taken to searching for recruits abroad, persuading four South Korean priests to fill the gaps of his aging clergy.

"We are depending on the voters of Puerto Rico in our fight to secure the nomination," Clinton said in an email to supporters. Ahead of a fresh campaign swing through the main island this weekend, Clinton Thursday sprinkled a little showbiz stardust, announcing the endorsement of Puerto Rican Grammy award-winning singer Ricky Martin. "These elections will have historic repercussions both in the United States and the world. Senator Clinton has always been consistent in her commitment with the needs of the Latino community," Martin said in a statement. Polling has been sparse on the mainly Spanish-speaking island, and political sentiment is difficult to gauge, but Clinton is tipped to use her hold among Latino voters to take a victory. But Clinton hopes to emerge from Puerto Rico and the last two contests in Montana and South Dakota on Tuesday leading the popular vote, to convince her party that she is the most viable The Clinton camp however says that the number needed to grab the nomination is actually 2,210, including delegates stripped from Michigan and Florida, punished for moving their primaries forward Both Clinton, and Obama, who has also campaigned on the island, have walked a fine line on constitutional issues -- saying that it is up to Puerto Ricans themselves to decide their status.

Gates is to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee  for a day of hearings, before a vote on his nomination by the full  Senate, most likely later this week. Senator Joe Biden, incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he would support Gates, despite voting against him when he was nominated to be CIA director by former President George Bush. "I think Gates's position on Iraq is much closer to what we need  to move to," Biden told Fox. "I will vote for Gates, and I believe  Gates will be able to do a good job." Still, Gates cannot expect easy confirmation hearings as  Democrats, emboldened by a sweeping victory in last month's  legislative elections, use the platform to criticize administration  policy in "Mr. Gates must persuade Congress and the American people that  he will be a strong leader, that he is firmly committed to working within the administration and with the Congress toward a new course commitment of our military will not bring America closer to  victory," "More of the same failed policy that depends on an open-ended Kennedy added after meeting with Gates on Thursday.

In his first written answers to questions submitted by the  Senate Armed Services Committee, Gates said he also favored this  option.

CONTEXT	The discovery "was a complete shock," said Mark Aldenderfer, an  anthropologist at the University of Arizona. Scott Raymond, an archaeologist at the University of Calgary, Canada, said the date of the necklace is "remarkably early for that region to have something of that order." The research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the University of Missouri. Oldest gold jewelry of the Americas found in southern Peru burial site near Lake Titicaca, researchers report in Tuesday's The gold necklace, made nearly 4,000 years ago, was found in a issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Someone, though, had the time and knowledge to make this ornament, which he speculates is a sign of importance. There is no evidence at the site that shows how it was made, he said. But it looks like a nugget of native raw gold, which occurs near the area, was pounded flat in a stone mortar and pestle. Then the gold was probably wrapped around a piece of wood and pounded until it was folded into a tube, he said. The researchers restrung the necklace, alternating nine small gold tubes with a series of round stones, identified as either greenstone or turquoise, with holes in them that were found in the same grave. He said he had not previously seen any substantial evidence from that period of the kind of ceremonialism that developed later. Peru and dated to about 3,500 years ago, said Raymond, who was The oldest previously known worked gold was found in highland not part of the research team. Heather Lechtman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called the design "very interesting for such a very early piece of jewelry." Lechtman, who was not part of the research team, said it was not surprising that early people used gold because it is available in that area and easy to work.

"If elected, I would immediately engage in talks with (the mainland) on the basis of the '1992 consensus'," he told a group of Taiwan businesspeople, referring to an agreement reached between the former KMT government and Beijing in 1992. Taiwan and China split in 1949 at the end of a civil war and are still technically at war despite their commencement of civil exchanges in 1987. He said he also hoped for closer economic ties with China, including the opening of the "three direct links" -- transportation, commercial and postal services which have been cut since 1949. Calls for the resumption of direct links have been mounting given ever closer economic ties but Taiwan says government-level negotiations -- which would imply Beijing recognition -- are Despite the lingering political standoff, China has been Taiwan's largest trading partner since late 2002 and the island's businesspeople have been major investors on the mainland. Bilateral trade in 2006 rose to 88.12 billion US dollars, up 15.4 percent according to figures released by Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade. Taiwan opposition leader vows to end hostility with China The presidential candidate for Taiwan's leading opposition Kuomintang on Monday vowed to end hostility with rival China and inaugurate direct transportation links if elected in the 2008 polls.

He told The Bulletin he quit because he had read most of the books in the library and feared Ardeshir Mohassess, an Iranian artist long resident in America who pushed the art of the cartoon to almost Surrealist satire of his native land in work both popular and profound -- pulsating with slain and mutilated shahs, mullahs and ordinary citizens; Ardashir Mohases or Mohasses, defied easy definition. He was a Mohassess, whose name was sometimes transliterated from Farsi as caricaturist often compared with Saul Steinberg for the bite and style of his cartoons, but he also drew inspiration from masters like Daumier and Picasso, as well as from Iranian religious art of the 16th and 17th centuries. Mohassess himself insisted he was most of all a reporter, Nodjoumi said. His reportage was directed at the most disquieting elements he saw in Iran's identity -- selfishness, tyranny, Pahlavi, who ruled Iran from 1941 to 1979, took exception to his although he fled to New York in 1976, after Shah Mohammed Reza work. His anti-shah cartoons used settings and costumes of the Qajar dynasty of 1794 to 1925 -- a misdirection that fooled nobody. After the Ayatollah Khomeini came to power in the Islamic revolution of 1979, Mohassess took more direct aim from his American exile at the new religious government: a drawing from 2000 shows lines of decapitated corpses laid neatly before seated aircraft strafes praying citizens. A turbaned figure draws a a noose over a sour-faced mob in turbans. A comically dilapidated picture of his own amputated feet; they rest on pedestals created by his own surreally upturned lower legs. Ardeshir Mohassess was born on Sept. 9, 1938, in Rasht, in northwest Iran. His mother was a poet and headmistress of the first school for women in Rasht; his father was a judge, and his maternal grandmother painted at home. At 3, he began drawing The Nation, Playboy and elsewhere. He also exhibited in galleries York in 1977, where he was soon published in The New York Times, and drew the attention of critics fascinated by his eclectic influences, which included centuries-old Shiite art depicting eye-popping violence. death. Earlier this year the Asia Society had a major exhibition Despite having Parkinson's disease, he worked almost until his of his work. A gallery in Tehran showed his work in each of the last three years, with brisk sales each time. Mohassess is survived by a sister, Irandoukht Mohassess, and a brother, Darush Mohassess, both of Tehran.

Piasecki's designs were first used He built his earliest helicopter models from parts he found in an auto junkyard near Philadelphia, and in 1943 followed Sikorsky as the second American to successfully fly a helicopter, the single- rotor PV-2. One of his notorious failures was the Heli-Stat, a 343-foot-long airship made from a helium blimp and four surplus Sikorsky helicopters. It was designed for the U.S. Forest Service to help with timber harvesting in remote areas.

Hungarians make Szeklers. Little wonder that Romania, a member of the European Union and the host of the just-completed NATO summit meeting, joined Slovakia, Serbia and Russia in refusing to recognize Unlike the Kosovars, the Szeklers are asking for autonomy within Romania rather than complete independence, leaving foreign policy and national defense in the hands of the government in Bucharest. Szeklerland would be nearly 4,000 square miles, with just over 800,000 people, three-quarters of them Hungarian.

Republicans John McCain and Sarah Palin stand accused Monday of trying to "lie" their way into the White House with discredited claims and advertising -- and it's not just outgunned Democrats Non-partisan fact-check operations, newspapers and opinion columnists are also charging McCain, once a darling of the press, of cloaking the election in sleaze and unfairly smearing Democrat Barack Obama. US election campaigns and hardball advertising always push the limits of truth and often amount to outright distortion -- the Obama camp has not hesitated to blur McCain's record too. Campaigns and experts usually steer clear of blatantly accusing a candidate of lying, but the term is being bandied about following McCain's latest hard- hitting assault on Obama's character and defense of Palin's record. Last week, the McCain campaign accused Obama of wanting to teach sex education in kindergarten. In reality, the bill he voted for as an Illinois lawmaker mandated warnings for young children Palin was accused of saying she visited Alaskan troops in Iraq when it emerged her trip was to an Iraq/Kuwaiti border post. sparsely-inhabited island in her state which she initially backed notorious multi- million dollar project to build a bridge to a and of not fully returning all the federal dollars doled out for it. The McCain camp is also now being accused in news reports of embellishing attendance figures at campaign rallies.

"The claim is simply false," said FactCheck.org of the sex education ad. The St Petersburg Times complained: "McCain's straight talk has become a toxic mix of lies and double-speak. been playing hard knocks-style politics for more than 20 years, Republicans, like President George W. Bush's guru Karl Rove, have often taking a Democrat's perceived strength and turning it into a liability. Ironically, McCain was a victim of such treatment, bowed out embittered by the 2000 primary campaign against Bush and apparently not willing to take the high road again. Governor Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota Sunday said Democrats were descending into "hysteria." Another top McCain aide Carly Fiorina said McCain's foes were panicking and accused them of unfairly "They are trying to put Obama on the defensive... to make a whiner out of him," said Powell. "A lot of things are happening at once," she said, mentioning positive advertisements the campaign is running and speeches by McCain on issues. Palin is also reinvigorating Republicans. McCain's aides are like "guerrilla fighters fighting those who are following Marquis of Queensbury rules," he said.

Her drive to clean up the gas trade with Russia plays well with the public, and she has gained further popularity with a program to compensate Ukrainians for the savings they lost due to Meanwhile, she is once again at odds with Yushchenko. She is attacking his latest gas deal with Russia, while he is accusing her of lying and scheming to increase her power. So their power- sharing deal is very shaky.

The Iraqi foreign minister, meanwhile, called on Sunday for the release of five Iranians detained by U.S. forces in what he said was a legitimate diplomatic mission in northern Iraq, but he stressed that foreign intervention to help insurgents would not secure Baghdad with the help of American forces while maintaining the delicate balance facing the Iraqi government as it tries to ties with its neighbors, including U.S. rivals Iran and Syria. "You have to remember, our destiny, as Iraqis, we have to live in this part of the world. And we have to live with Iran, we have to live with Syria and Turkey and other countries," he said. "So in fact, on the other hand, the Iraqi government is committed to The U.S. military said the five Iranians detained last week in the Kurdish-controlled northern city of Irbil were connected to an Iranian Revolutionary Guard faction that funds and arms insurgents in Iraq. It was the second U.S. raid targeting Iranians in Iraq in less than a month. Iran's government denied the five detainees were involved in financing and arming insurgents and called for their release along with compensation for damages. "Their job was basically consular, official and in the framework of regulations," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said Sunday. "What the Americans express was incorrect and hyperbole against Iran in order to justify their acts." In Nicaragua, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the U.S. was trying to hide its failures in Iraq by accusing his nation of funding Iraqi insurgents. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines

CONTEXT	 The Philippines' two largest Muslim rebel groups, which have fought separately for self-rule, will merge to help achieve lasting peace in the troubled southern region of Mindanao, a former rebel leader said In August, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front reached a ``unity agreement'' ending more than two decades of rivalry in a move they say will boost their autonomy ``This is unity for stability, unity for sustained development and unity for lasting peace,'' MNLF leader Parouk Hussin told the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines. ``For the time being, we will maintain two structures, but eventually we will form one single body to represent us in all international fora, including the Islamic Conference Organization,'' Hussin said. He said the move was in response to the ``collective desire of the membership of the OIC for us to have a common position for justice, for progress and for development, and this is exactly what we are The MNLF, once the largest Muslim separatist group, signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government in 1996, accepting autonomy and dropping its bid for independence. The peace talks were brokered by the Islamic Conference, which represents more than 50 Muslim states. The MILF, led by former MNLF vice chairman Salamat Hashim, broke away from the MNLF in 1978. It surfaced as a new faction a few years later following a leadership dispute with Misuari but continued to wage a separate war against the national government. The MILF reopened peace talks with the government of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in June after pulling out of negotiations last year under then-President Joseph Estrada. MILF spokesman Eid Kabalu has said the MILF-MNLF unity talks were pushed by Malaysia, Libya and Indonesia, the three Muslim nations that have helped the Philippine government deal with Islamic separatists over the years. Jakarta brokered talks between Manila and the MNLF. Libya hosted the reopened talks with the MILF, and Malaysia hosted the last round of negotiations last month. Hussin said the current talks between the government and the MILF indicated the rebel group will no longer pursue an independent Islamic state. ``The fact that they have agreed to sit down with the government in Libya and Malaysia, it's very clear that they have climbed down from their hardline position of sovereignty to autonomy. Why? Because Malaysia, Libya, have made their position very clear _ they will not allow themselves to be used if the position is not for autonomy,'' Hussin said. Hussin is coordinator of an executive committee that has replaced Misuari as head of the MNLF over ``dissatisfaction and disappointment'' over his leadership. ``Because of this, we thought that it's about time to reform the MNLF from within,'' he said.

He will also be donating several now-defunct Apple II For every game he developed, he saved and labeled the first 10 computers and framed posters from every game he helped develop. The main driver behind the archive is Spector, who received his graduate degree from UT. He sent a passionate letter to Carleton last September, pleading his case for an archive. "Academics need access to primary sources," Spector said in the letter. "UT could be the hub of a new and burgeoning field of academic study, one that's of growing importance." Carleton said UT isn't out to become the "number one" archive for video games in the country. But it does want to be the best in Texas. With nearly 100 video game companies in Dallas and Austin, UT is in a position to be a big player in documenting this burgeoning industry's history. The Center for American History is visited by about 15,000 people a year. It is based at UT's Austin campus, and most of its collections are housed at Sid Richardson Hall. The center also operates two museums outside of Austin.

CONTEXT	Deering, director of health communication and ``telehealth'' at the ``I jokingly call them the good, the bad and the ugly,'' said Mary Jo United States Department of Health and Human Services. ``Sometimes it is hard to tell them apart because the ugly may have some good mixed into it and the good can have a little ugliness to it.''  But a growing number of physicians, government health officials and other healthcare providers are asking whether medical information on the Internet is accurate and trustworthy, and whether a layperson can There are an estimated 250,000 health-related Web sites (this figure excludes Usenet newsgroups devoted to health issues). While some of these sites are affiliated with research universities, medical schools and renowned clinics, others have dubious credentials, if any. Currently, there are three major suggestions on how to control the quality of health information on the Web. One is to enact the standards and regulations that now apply to existing traditional media medical publishers. This would require a prestigious association _ This option, however, is unlikely to gather the necessary momentum to be become reality because of complicated legal issues as well as a question of how much time it would take to evaluate a site and who would pay for that process.

The major sites that currently provide this service are the University and medical school sites also often have links to health pages.

One of the problems we are trying to solve is information overload. We accomplish this by trying to keep a good representative distribution of material.'' But Dr. Stephen Barrett, the founder of the appropriately named Quackwatch Web site that tries to expose ``ugly'' sites and point out errors on ``good'' sites, says that such lists can often link to pages that have misinformation and even to ``quacky'' sites. The problem stems from the fact that each Web site will have many layers of pages, making the evaluation of extensive listings almost monumental. ``We have a procedure in place for looking at new information resources and we are of course updating them to match the electronic age,'' Deering added. and medical information be appropriately skeptical,'' said William ``It is important that people who are using the Net to gather health Silberg, editorial director of the American Medical Association's scientific information and multimedia group. ``They have to apply the same sorts of standards and evaluation processes and critical thinking Barrett again questions whether a lay consumer has the background to be able to effectively determine the quality of medical sites. ``One of my theories is that anyone who is not an expert simply cannot sort out what is accurate from what is not accurate,'' Barrett said. ``It makes about as much sense for consumers to think they can as credible one appear to be much more restrictive, even when compared to Barrett's standards for distinguishing a ``quack'' site from a health-related government sites. He has formulated a list of red flags, that he calls ``quacky'' signs. These include simple statements like ``losing weight is easy,'' or ``special diets can cure cancer.'' If any of these signs appear on the site, he advises you to leave. But one gets the sense speaking to Barrett that its best to turn off your computer and head straight for the doctor's office for any kind of medical information. John Mack, president of the Internet Healthcare Coalition, explains that he thinks that while Barrett has a strong definition of what is medically and scientifically valid, there are other physicians whose Where there is an opportunity for profit, whether on or off the Internet, there's a chance that someone will offer fraudulent services. One of the Internet Healthcare Coalition's goals is to help Mack said his organization is concerned that there will be no distinction made between the pitching and sales of medical products and sites that provide information. ``The ability of the Internet to supply information is what makes it what it is today,'' said Mack. ``If there's no distinction made between a person selling fraudulent products and someone trying to Silberg reiterated his position that was published in an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association: ``It's important to begin thinking about the issues of regulation and education. To raise important questions which I think will result in the quality sites Whichever way is chosen to tackle the quality of medical information on the Internet, one thing is clear: a growing number of people will continue to log on to try to figure out why they are feeling sick and Web research is increasingly a common option for people trying to gather health-related information. Many are even going as far as basing their healthcare decisions on the knowledge gained on the Internet. The second option, already implemented on the Web, is for reliable sites to evaluate and list what they consider to be credible health The Health on the Net Foundation, an organization based in Europe, provides guidelines to differentiate credible sites from the dubious ones. people avoid the pitfall by educating consumers on how to find high- quality healthcare information and services.

Security Council Pirates have made an estimated $30 million hijacking ships for ransom this year, seizing more than 40 vessels off Somalia's 1,880-mile (3,000-kilometer) coastline. Deploying ships to the Gulf of Aden marks a significant step in the evolution of China's navy, according to a report by Stratfor, an Austin, Texas-based intelligence company. The mission will be complicated, offering vital on-the-job training in refueling, resupply and repairs far from home as well as patrolling for pirates, Stratfor said. "In the event of an accident or a run-in with pirates," Stratfor said, "would a Chinese vessel carry out repairs at sea, head to a nearby port, perhaps in Pakistan, or return to China?" China's willingness to send ships so far from home is also the latest example of the growing power and confidence of the country's navy.

Until now, China's information sector -- while undergoing rapid expansion -- has been hampered by a chronic lack of communication between government agencies and different industries. Hao said his ministry planned to expand the new network, known as CHINADDN, by building a second phase next year that will hook up an additional 300 cities. All computer and information networks will ultimately be linked through CHINADDN, forming a public information network with functions including human-to-computer and computer-to-computer communication, Hao added.

The Hawks posted the second-best 17-5 record in the regular season. Both sides have strong midfields and forward lines and all-around toughness. So tough, that the AFL office has said any foul moves will be penalized with heavier than usual fines and suspensions to start next season. Hawthorn and Geelong have met in a grand final since 1989, when the Hawks won back-to-back titles by holding off the Gary Ablett- inspired Cats. The roles are reversed entering this game -- the Cats are seeking back-to-back wins for the first time since 1951-52, and Gary Ablett Jr., the elder footballer's 24-year-old son, is the leader of the Cats midfield. The last time the teams met -- in the 17th round this season -- Geelong eked out an 11-point victory in a close match in which the Hawks missed several late shots at goals, which are worth six The bookmakers have made the Cats, from a mostly industrial port city about an hour's drive southwest of Melbourne, favorites, although Hawthorn, an inner-city Melbourne suburb, will have more local fans to draw from when up to 100,000 cram the Melbourne Cricket Ground for Saturday afternoon's match. Club supporters got into the mood by watching the teams' final training sessions on Thursday -- 10,000 packed the Hawks' training venue at Waverley Park, while 8,000 watched the Cats at Geelong. On Friday, some downtown streets in Melbourne were closed for the annual grand final parade. Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett, a former premier of Victoria state, was surprised at the large gathering for the practice session, saying he had "never seen anything like it." Kennett predicted the grand final could be a game "in terms of the modern era that becomes the benchmark for football for the next decade." The Cats held a light training session after Friday's parade, with all 22 selected players participating at the MCG. "We're probably 90 percent sure it will be the team. You've got to leave 10 per cent because people can get sick overnight," Geelong coach Mark Thompson said. Cats, Hawks meet in Aussie Rules final

CONTEXT	 The Department of National Defense announced Tuesday that it would launch its own investigation, but only after the commission said it was considering a public inquiry. Peter Tinsley, chair of the independent Military Police Complaints Commission, said his decision was based on a formal complaint by Amir Attaran, a University of Ottawa law professor. In the complaint filed at the end of January, Attaran said at least one, and possibly three Afghan men appear to have been beaten while detained and interrogated by Canadian military "The possible abuse of defenseless persons in CF custody, regardless of their actions prior to apprehension, and the possibility that military police members may have knowingly or negligently failed to investigate such abuse ... are matters of serious concern," Tinsley said. The commission was established by Parliament in 1998 in the wake of an incident that resulted in a dark stain on Canadian Forces. attempts to cover up his death. The scandal ended up before the a Somali teenager in 1993 and the death was followed by failed courts and a formal public inquiry led to the disbanding of the regiment. O'Connor said there was no proof of any prisoner abuse, but said the allegations were being taken seriously. Attaran said he stumbled upon the cases while investigating the "pernicious policy" of Canadian forces handing over detainees to the Afghan National Police, whom he called "self-confessed torturers." The three Afghans were captured near Dukah by a small group of Canadian soldiers positioned on a hill above the small town in southern Afghanistan. A military police transfer log said the detainee's injuries included lacerations on both eyebrows, contusions and swelling of both eyes, cuts to his left cheek and forehead, as well as abrasions and multiple contusions on his upper arms, back and Defense Minister Gordon O'Connor said Tuesday that the military would welcome a commission inquiry.

It does come out of the pessimism of any way to fight global warming. These approaches are not an greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are the only real alternative to cutting pollution, said University of Calgary professor David Keith, a top geoengineering researcher. For far-out concepts, it is hard to beat Roger Angel's. Last fall, the University of Arizona astronomer proposed what he called a "sun shade." It would be a cloud of small Frisbee-like spaceships that go between Earth and the sun and act as an Nearly a decade ago, Columbia University professor Klaus Lackner, hit on an idea for his then-middle school daughter's science fair project: Create air filters that grab carbon dioxide from the air The Earth Engineering Center of Columbia University: http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/ Using smoke, mirrors and faux trees to tackle global warming, geoengineers offer far-out ideas Crazy-sounding ideas for saving the planet are getting a serious look from top scientists, a sign of their fears about global warming and the desire for an insurance policy in case things get worse. There is the man-made "volcano" that shoots gigatons of sulfur high into the air. The space "sun shade" made of trillions of little reflectors between Earth and sun, slightly lowering the planet's temperature. The forest of ugly artificial "trees" that suck carbon dioxide out of the air. And the "Geritol solution" in which iron dust is dumped into the ocean. NASA is putting the finishing touches on a report summing up some of these ideas and has spent $75,000 (euro56,706) to map out rough details of the sun shade concept. One of the premier climate modeling centers in the United States, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, has spent the last six weeks running computer simulations of the man-made volcano scenario and will soon turn its attention to the space umbrella idea. And last month, billionaire Richard Branson offered a $25 million (euro18.9 million) prize to the first feasible technology to reduce carbon dioxide levels in the air. Simon "Pete" Worden, who heads NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, says some of these proposals, which represent a field called geoengineering, have been characterized as anywhere from "great" to "idiotic." As if to distance NASA from the issue a bit, Worden said the agency's report won't do much more than explain the range of possibilities. such concepts. Many fear there will be unintended side effects; Scientists in the recent past have been reluctant to consider others worry such schemes might prevent the type of reduction in Last month, Ralph Cicerone, president of the National Academy of Sciences, told the nation's largest science conference that more research must be done in this field, but no action should be Here is a look at some of the ideas: Planktos Inc. of Foster City, California, last week launched its ship, the Weatherbird II, on a trip to the Pacific Ocean to dump 50 tons of iron dust. The iron should grow plankton, part of an The idea of seeding the ocean with iron to beef up a natural plankton and algae system has been tried on a small scale several times since 1990. It has both succeeded and failed. Planktos chief executive officer Russ George said his ship will try it on a larger scale, dumping a slurry of water and red iron dust from a hose into the sea. "It makes a 25-foot (7.6-meter) swath of bright red for a very short period of time," George said. Small experiments "showed unequivocally that there was a biological response to the addition of the iron," the climate report said. Plankton used the iron to photosynthesize, extract greenhouse gases from the air, and grow rapidly. It forms a thick green soup of all sorts of carbon dioxide-sucking algae, which sea life feast on, and the carbon drops into the ocean. However, the international climate report also cautioned about "the ecological consequences of large-scale fertilization of the ocean." Tim Barnett, a marine physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said large-scale ocean seeding could change the crucial temperature difference between the sea surface and deeper Cicerone, a climate scientist who is president of the National Academy of Sciences and advocate for more geoengineering research, called the Geritol solution promising. However, he in open international seas so he needs no permits. Most scientific research. He said his firm will be dropping the iron important, he said, is that it is such a small amount of iron compared to the ocean volume that it poses no threat. Planktos officials say that for every ton of iron used, 100,000 tons of carbon will be pulled into the ocean. Eventually, if this first large-scale test works, George hopes to remove 3 billion tons of carbon from the Earth's atmosphere, half of what's needed. Some scientists say that's overstated. Planktos' efforts are financed by companies and individuals who buy carbon credits to offset their use of fossil fuels. the late nuclear cold warrior Edward Teller, have proposed doing Several leading scientists, from Nobel Laureate Paul Crutzen to the same artificially to offset global warming. current sulfur pollution by a small percentage, said Tom Wigley air, humans could reduce the solar heat, and only increase of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

Newly inspired by the $25 million (euro18.9 million) prize offered by Richard Branson, Lackner has fine-tuned the idea. He wants to develop a large filter that would absorb carbon dioxide from the air. Another chemical reaction would take the carbon from the absorbent material, and then a third process would change that greenhouse gas into a form that could be disposed of. It would take wind and a lot of energy to power the air capture devices. They would stand tall like cell phone towers on steroids, reaching about 200 feet (61 meters) high with various- sized square filters at the top. Lackner envisions perhaps placing 100,000 of them near wind energy turbines. Even if each filter was only the size of a television, it could remove about 25 tons of carbon dioxide a year, which is about how much one American produces annually, Lackner said. The captured Disposal of carbon dioxide, including that from fossil fuel plant emissions, is a major issue of scientific and technological research called sequestration. The idea is to bury it underground, often in old oil wells or deep below the sea floor.

The Macau-based Air Macau operates 10 flights between Taipei and Macau, and four flights between the southern port city of Kaohsiung and Macau on a daily basis, carrying mainly Taiwanese Air Macau CEO David Fei commended the applicants as ambitious and well-prepared, adding that attitude was the key factor in the selection process.

CONTEXT	 The Health Department's findings comes as the nurses -- all Filipino immigrants -- are scheduled for trial Jan. 28 on charges of conspiracy and endangering disabled people and children in a Prosecutors and the nursing home owners contend that the nurses endangered patients by prompting a staffing crisis with their resignations on April 7, 2006. However, records reviewed by the Health Department's Office of Long-term Care showed that the nursing home was fully staffed after the nurses' departure, said Jeffrey Hammond, a Health Department spokesman. "The shifts were covered and patients were not placed in jeopardy," Hammond said. The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office questioned the thoroughness of the Health Department's inquiry and defended the grand jury probe that led to nurses' indictment in March. Still, the Health Department is the second major state government agency to support the nurses' claims that patients were not endangered. The State Education Department, which licenses nurses, found in 2006 that the nurses did not abandon patients. "This is the final straw," defense attorney Oscar Michelen said. "This is vindication that these nurses did nothing wrong, especially when it is the department in charge of patient care The inquiry was begun in October to determine why Avalon Gardens did not inform state health authorities of the incident. Newsday articles on Sept. 23 and 24 reported that all shifts were covered on the day the nurses resigned and described connections between the nursing home owners' political relationships and the indictment last March of the nurses. State law requires a nursing home to report any "mistreatment, neglect and abuse" to the Health Department. The district attorney's probe began after a private meeting District Attorney Thomas Spota held with the nursing home's owners, attorney and administrator in May 2006. Spota had received $1,500 in campaign contributions from the attorney, Howard Fensterman, a prominent Democratic Party fund-raiser. Fensterman and Spota have said the contribution played no role in the investigation. Robert Clifford, a spokesman for Spota, said in a statement that the Health Department did not contact the the district attorney's office. "The 10 nurses and their attorney are under indictment after a grand jury heard evidence that they endangered the welfare of children and a disabled person who are dependent on mechanical ventilators to breathe," Clifford said. Assistant District Attorney Leonard Lato said the Health Department did not visit the nursing home or contact its administrator. Rather, Lato said, the department asked one of the nursing home's owners for records showing which nurses were on call to fill shifts left open by the resigning Filipinos. "That's it. Nothing beyond pure numbers. No doctor was spoken with, no nurse, nobody who was actually caring for these children," said Lato, who said his information came from the nursing home's administrator Susan O'Connor. Hammond said he could not say whether an on-site visit was made. including Avalon Gardens, declined to make O'Connor available for Gary Lewi, a spokesman for SentosaCare, a group of nursing homes interviews because she will testify at the upcoming trial. pediatric ventilation unit at Avalon Gardens Rehabilitation and Health Care Center. saying it."

Public dissatisfaction had remained relatively muted until last Labor Day, when the usually sleepy streets of Macau, a former Portuguese colony that is now governed by China, were pierced with police gunshots. An officer trying to hold back thousands of union marchers protesting government corruption fired shots into the air, one of which is suspected of injuring a passing motorcyclist nearly As the march continued, officers used pepper spray and batons to control the crowd. Dozens of protesters and 21 police officers were injured, authorities said. At the forefront of the protest were local construction workers.

As the Macau government tries to enact reforms, the casino industry continues to expand, with the addition of American stalwarts such as Las Vegas Sands Corp., which is scheduled to open the Venetian-Macau this summer. The casinos helped attract 22 million tourists last year, half of them from China. Inside the opulent halls, visitors gamble the Chinese way -- on higher stakes tables, not slot machines. The bars are often empty. Tea and sandwiches are passed around. Macau earned $7 billion last year in gaming revenue playing this way, $300,000 Outside, however, many locals fear unbridled development is erasing the charm and character of Macau's history. ``The old system is lost,'' said Ho Heung Kok, president of the Macau Worker's Union and one of the Labor Day protest's chief organizers. ``Macau's prosperity is built on the bankruptcy of many people.

CONTEXT	A University of California search committee on Thursday formally  offered Mark Yudof, chancellor of the UT system since 2002, the job as the next president of the 10-campus California system. Blum said Yudof was the top pick for the job because of his reputation and because of his experience in running a big system in Texas. we've done, because we can't find anybody that anything bad to "First of all, there must be something wrong with the checks say about him," Blum said. One of his biggest supporters in California is Marye Anne Fox, a former vice president of UT Austin who's now the chancellor of UC San Diego. "I can understand why the UC regents would seek out Mark Yudof," H. Scott Caven, chairman of the UT System Board of Regents said in a statement. "He is, without question, one of the most outstanding leaders in public higher education today." Yudof's name surfaced earlier this week as the top pick to replace outgoing UC president Robert Dynes, who is planning to retire in June after five years in the job. leaving one of the best-paying university jobs in the country, If he takes the California job as expected, Yudof is not only but also a place where he has deep ties. He started his academic career at UT Austin in 1971 when he was appointed an assistant professor of law. He spent the next 26 years at UT, serving as dean of the law school from 1984-1994 and later as the university's executive vice president and provost. In 1997, he left to become president of the University of Minnesota, where he stayed for five years until returning to UT to become chancellor. He has continued to teach throughout his administrative career. Asked why Yudof wanted to leave UT, Blum said he thought it was a matter of prestige. "I think the University of Texas has a great system, but I think it's generally acknowledged that the best large system of higher education - not just in this country but the world - is the One of Yudof's first challenges in California, in fact, could be implementing major cutbacks and a reorganization of the very office he's inheriting. Earlier this week, UC officials introduced a plan that would cut the annual spending of the president's office by 20 percent and reduce its employment by more than 400 workers. System-wide cutbacks, hikes in student fees and other issues also will be on Yudof's plate. Larry Faulkner, a former president of UT-Austin who worked closely with Yudof, said it's not surprising his former co-worker is willing to take on the challenges in California. a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Yudof does have some history in California, having once served as He also co-authored a book, "Education Policy and the Law" with Berkeley professor David Kirp. "Mark Yudof is an outstanding choice to lead the University of California - no one comes close," Kirp said in a statement Thursday. "At both Texas and Minnesota, he has demonstrated a unique combination of commitment to academic values, skill at managing and restructuring complex institutions and effective engagement with public leaders." Austin American-Statesman reporter Ralph Haurwitz contributed to this story. SAN FRANCISCO - After six years in Austin, it looks like the chancellor of the University of Texas system is heading to California. In Austin, Yudof is one of the best-paid university administrators in the country, making an estimated $742,000-plus in salary and other compensation. Fox worked for several years with Yudof in Austin and "couldn't speak more highly of him," Blum said. The University of Texas System Board of Regents has scheduled a special meeting in Austin for next Wednesday, apparently in part to discuss Yudof's planned departure.

"Stanley Ho's not going to do very well," boasts Sheldon G. Adelson, chairman of Las Vegas Sands Corp. and one of the big new investors here. "He's always been a monopolist.

According to gambling historians here, the bulk of Ho's gambling revenue came from VIP rooms he subcontracted out to groups that lured Asia's high rollers to Macau; the subcontractors shared the gambling profits with Ho's casinos. Law enforcement officials and gambling analysts say that many of the VIP room operators had links to Chinese organized crime groups known as triads. Gambling experts say that Ho's subcontracting of the VIP rooms was an inspired business move because it required little investment on his part. It also essentially outsourced the collection of huge gambling debts. By subcontracting the VIP rooms, Ho's casinos had only to provide the rooms, chips and dealers; the casino did not have to search for big customers, do That cash spigot came under threat in 1999, when Portugal returned Macau to Chinese control after more than 440 years of colonial rule, and again in 2002, when Ho's license to retain a monopoly hold on gambling in the former colony was set to expire. On both occasions, Ho scrambled to soften the impact of the shifts. Worried about a communist takeover in the late '90s, he continued to diversify his holdings, which came to include shipping, entertainment and real estate, while also relocating some of his investments offshore. He also tried to retain his control of Macau's gambling business by getting his monopoly license extended, but the fate of that effort was probably sealed when rival gangs fought for control of his VIP rooms before China took control of the colony. A rash of shootings, stabbings and bombings occurred near Macau's casinos. An official working for Ho was murdered in Victoria Park in Hong Kong, and a senior Portuguese official who came to the city to help calm things down was shot in the face. Press accounts were filled with stories of gangsters terrorizing the city. The bloodletting ceased only after China took control of Macau and deployed its army to end gang warfare. Law enforcement officials never publicly accused Ho of being an organized-crime figure, but even Ho himself never denied that organized-crime figures operated in his casinos. In a written on organized crime, anyone involved in gaming was vulnerable to "During the period before the liberalization and the crackdowns such accusations" of having links to organized crime. He added that in his case, "There has been no concrete evidence to back up such accusations." Others say Ho has navigated complex relationships for years.

Although Ho lost his That's why 21 casino operators from around the world bid for a monopoly in 2002, he still managed to secure one of just three major gambling concessions Macau awarded that year, pitting him against seasoned U.S. casino operators like Wynn and Adelson. The newly opened Wynn Macau is spectacularly plush; the $1 billion MGM Grand Macau will open at the end of this year, featuring a 600-room hotel and casino. And Adelson, of Las Vegas Sands, plans to bring Venice to Macau with an outsized hotel and casino called the Venetian; it will offer 500,000 square feet of gambling space and 6,000 slot machines. Partly because of his ambitious plans for Macau, the company that Adelson took public in 2004 now has a stock market capitalization of $32 billion, making it the world's most valuable gambling doorways as they stampeded to enter. The Venetian represents an concern. When his Sands casino opened here in 2004, people broke effort to take further advantage of that demand. "This is just the tip of the iceberg," Adelson said. Still, analysts are hesitant to count out Ho. "He's the kind of guy who won't accept defeat," says Ricardo Pinto, publisher of the Macau Closer magazine.

Then he helped that company, Melco International Development, form a joint venture with Publishing &amp; Broadcasting Ltd., one of Australia's biggest media and entertainment companies. The new joint venture, Melco PBL, is building several large casinos and hotels in the city. It went public in the United States last year and already carries a stock market valuation of $6.8 billion. Mirage, giving her a 50 percent stake in a company that is his Shun Tak conglomerate, formed a joint venture with MGM building some of Macau's biggest casinos. Ho is also fortifying his own casino giant, SJM, by investing in dozens of real estate and casino projects around Macau, including the $800 million Oceanus casino, which is designed in the shape of a silvery ship. His latest show of strength, the opening of But to succeed, he must cope with something his competitors are not facing: a relentless series of attacks on his career and the means by which he amassed a privately held fortune that analysts estimate to be worth several billion dollars. regulators in Canada, Australia, the Philippines and Singapore empire. Though Ho has never been charged with a crime, gambling have repeatedly investigated Ho's background and have often blocked or discouraged his entry into their gambling markets. "There are volumes of controversy surrounding Dr. Stanley Ho, both historic and present," one Nevada regulator told The Associated Press last month. "From my perspective, he operates in In a civil court case in Hong Kong involving a group of Chinese bank officials who were accused of fleeing to the United States from China with hundreds of millions of dollars, evidence has surfaced that some of the money was laundered through Ho's casinos. Merkt, a former gambling regulator, called on state regulators to examining Pansy Ho's deal with MGM Mirage. Assemblyman Richard A. investigate Ho because of his concerns about Ho's possible organized-crime ties. Pansy Ho declined to comment for this article. For its part, the Justice Department said in a March 2006 report on narcotics control and money laundering that because of the old monopoly framework in Macau, "organized crime groups were, and continue to be, associated with the gaming industry through their control of VIP gaming rooms and activities such as racketeering, loan sharking and prostitution." Turmoil is also brewing closer to home. Although Ho has announced plans to take SJM public in an offering that analysts say could raise $2 billion, the public offering has been mired in a legal battle with Winnie Ho, his sister. Winnie Ho has contended in a lawsuit filed in Macau that she actually provided most of the initial capital for the original company, STDM, in 1962, then helped run the company until 2001. But over the years, she says, her brother cheated her out of her shares and cheated investors out of $3.9 billion in dividends over four decades. Ho declined to comment on the lawsuit for this article but in court has disputed many of his sister's allegations. She declined to comment about the dispute. MACAU Ho declined repeated interview requests for this article, but a spokesman for his company, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, or SJM, said Ho is confident he can meet the competitive threats posed by outsiders staking claims to the gambling boom.

CONTEXT	A University of California search committee on Thursday formally  offered Mark Yudof, chancellor of the UT system since 2002, the job as the next president of the 10-campus California system. Blum said Yudof was the top pick for the job because of his reputation and because of his experience in running a big system in Texas. we've done, because we can't find anybody that anything bad to "First of all, there must be something wrong with the checks say about him," Blum said. One of his biggest supporters in California is Marye Anne Fox, a former vice president of UT Austin who's now the chancellor of UC San Diego. Fox, who said she has talked extensively with Yudof about the job, described him as someone who's attracted to a challenge - something that affected his decision about the UC job despite his deep ties to UT. "I think he was happy at UT," Fox said. "But the opportunity of addressing a real challenge that could have major repercussions throughout the world of higher education ././. I think is "I can understand why the UC regents would seek out Mark Yudof," H. Scott Caven, chairman of the UT System Board of Regents said in a statement. "He is, without question, one of the most outstanding leaders in public higher education today." Yudof's name surfaced earlier this week as the top pick to replace outgoing UC president Robert Dynes, who is planning to retire in June after five years in the job. leaving one of the best-paying university jobs in the country, If he takes the California job as expected, Yudof is not only but also a place where he has deep ties. He started his academic career at UT Austin in 1971 when he was appointed an assistant professor of law. He spent the next 26 years at UT, serving as dean of the law school from 1984-1994 and later as the university's executive vice president and provost. In 1997, he left to become president of the University of Minnesota, where he stayed for five years until returning to UT to become chancellor. He has continued to teach throughout his administrative career. Asked why Yudof wanted to leave UT, Blum said he thought it was a matter of prestige. "I think the University of Texas has a great system, but I think it's generally acknowledged that the best large system of higher education - not just in this country but the world - is the One measure of the UC System?s prestige is that six of its 10 campuses are top-tier academic research institutions. Its campus in San Francisco is a leading health science center. Although the UT System has outstanding medical institutions, including the campuses at Dallas and Houston, it has just one top-tier academic campus, UT-Austin. One of Yudof's first challenges in California, in fact, could be implementing major cutbacks and a reorganization of the very office he's inheriting. Earlier this week, UC officials introduced a plan that would cut the annual spending of the president's office by 20 percent and reduce its employment by more than 400 workers. System-wide cutbacks, hikes in student fees and other issues also will be on Yudof's plate. Larry Faulkner, a former president of UT-Austin who worked closely with Yudof, said it's not surprising his former co-worker is willing to take on the challenges in California. a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Yudof does have some history in California, having once served as He also co-authored a book, "Education Policy and the Law" with Berkeley professor David Kirp. "Mark Yudof is an outstanding choice to lead the University of California - no one comes close," Kirp said in a statement Thursday. "At both Texas and Minnesota, he has demonstrated a unique combination of committment to academic values, skill at managing and restructuring complex institutions and effective engagement with public leaders." Universities and former chancellor of the UC Berkeley and former Robert Berdahl, president of the Association of American president of UT Austin, called Yudof "one of the genuine national leaders of higher education." Austin American-Statesman reporter Ralph Haurwitz contributed to this story. SAN FRANCISCO - After six years in Austin, it looks like the chancellor of the University of Texas system is heading to California. In Austin, Yudof is one of the best-paid university administrators in the country, making an estimated $742,000-plus in salary and other compensation. He would replace Robert Dynes, Fox worked for several years with Yudof in Austin and "couldn't speak more highly of him," Blum said. The University of Texas System Board of Regents has scheduled a special meeting in Austin for next Wednesday, apparently in part to discuss Yudof's planned departure.

He said that his party opposed the bill with a "heavy heart."  The left-of-center Congress Party government had earlier voted out a previous anti-terror measure because of its sweeping powers and potential for abuse. But in the wake of the Mumbai attacks, The leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, L.K. Advani, supported the new law but also reprimanded the Congress Party government for removing the earlier law. The party has traditionally advocated a tough approach and has bitterly attacked the Congress Party of being weak-kneed in its fight against terror. Responding to soaring public anger about security lapses after the Mumbai assault, the lower house of India's parliament on Wednesday passed a string of tough anti-terrorism laws and a plan to set up a national investigative agency. Activities (Prevention) Amendments Bill, that will facilitate the National Investigating Agency Bill and the Unlawful investigation and trial of the accused in cases of terrorism. They must go to the upper house, perhaps as soon as Thursday, but mostly as a formality. "You have captured the mood of the nation. The nation expects parliament to pass these laws today and restore their confidence," India's home minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, told the lawmakers after several hours of debate. When he presented the bills in the morning, he said he was appealing with "folded hands" for the members to pass it in a bipartisan manner. At the end of the day, he said: "For a jihadi terrorist, this is no deterrent. He comes here to die, he comes here to kill.

Pakistan has offered a joint probe and has detained some leaders of the group in the past few days. The two nuclear-armed neighbors have fought three wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947. The Mumbai assault and the subsequent war of words have sorely destabilized the ongoing peace process between the nations. Responding to the national outrage that followed the attacks, India has announced a comprehensive revamp of its security forces and strengthened coastal borders and intelligence agencies. Many lawmakers argued against a severe bill that would stifle the legal rights of many of the accused that the Indian constitution guarantees. Some said that the existing laws are enough to address terrorism and that the police should not be given complete freedom without accountability. Others said that the law might be used to unfairly target India's Muslim minority of 130 million people. The debate Wednesday reflected the classic challenge of meeting the demand for tough homeland security laws without trampling upon the fundamental rights of accused in a multi-religious "We have tried to accommodate the opinions and suggestions of different political parties and sections such as lawyers and jurists to draft the bills," Chidambaram said, adding that he had Analysts said that the government deftly appeased the growing anger of Indians toward frequent bomb blasts since May, without diluting the legal safeguards. The new law has increased the period of detention of suspects by the police and the judiciary from 90 to 180 days and seeks to choke the financial pipelines of groups suspected of abetting terrorism. But the law also makes the signed confession of suspects in police custody inadmissible in court, a crucial deterrent against coercive methods often used during The government also proposed the setting up of a national agency, along the lines of the FBI, to investigate and prosecute "offenses affecting the sovereignty, security and integrity" of But the agency will bring better coordination between the law state governments feared that their legal powers will be diluted. enforcement officials of various regions to combat terror groups that have spread through out the country in the recent months, officials said.

CONTEXT	 The Asian road to South Africa begins in earnest on Wednesday with the region's heavyweights joining World Cup qualifying, with at least one big nation guaranteed to fail. From an initial 41 teams, Asian sides have been whittled down to 20 and only the first and second in each of the five groups from third round qualifying will make the fourth and final round. With Australia, China and Asian champions Iraq all drawn together in a "group of death", at least one will crash out. The Socceroos begin their campaign under new coach Pim Verbeek in Melbourne against Asian Games winners Qatar. And they have plenty to prove after a disappointing Asian Cup last year where they failed to live up to their reputation. "I have now had six days with the players in Melbourne and I have made the decision that those players will not be required to travel to Australia," Verbeek said over the weekend. "Obviously, the three players are disappointed that I have not selected them, but I appreciate that they were available to come if I wanted them to." The other teams in Group A -- Iraq and China -- play each other on neutral territory in Dubai. After years of striving for international success, Iraq are longing to emulate their old feats in the 1980s, when qualified for Mexico 1986. Norwegian Egil Olsen is now in charge and they will be confident against China with skipper Younis Mahmoud again teaming up with strike partner Emad Mohammed. Nashat Akram will be keen to put the disappointment behind him of failing to get a British work permit after impressing during a trial with Manchester City. China has its own motivation to make only their second World Cup finals -- an eight million yuan (1.09 million dollars) bonus from the China Football Association if they qualify. In a New Year's pledge, the national side, lead by Charlton's Zheng Zhi, read an oath to the country, highlighting their determination. "I pledge to advance to the World Cup, which is the professional goal that we strive for," the players recited, according to state media. "We swear by death to kill along the bloody road of defending the honour of the motherland and realise our youthful dreams." Thai coach Chanvit Phalajivin is under no illusions that Japan will qualify for their fourth consecutive World Cup, but remains optimistic that his team can take second spot in the group. "It's a tough group, with Japan being the unquestionable favourites," he told Fifa.com. "However, I think we can take the group's second qualifying place by beating Bahrain and Oman." Verbeek's old team South Korea, Asia's most successful on the world stage having qualified for the past six World Cups, open their account at home against minnows Turkmenistan. Jordan and North Korea are the other teams in Group C. Singapore have a tough task against triple Asian champions Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, but their Serbian coach Radojko Avramovic has turned The Lions into a competitive team and a Saudi victory is by no means guaranteed. "It will be a hard match but we are not looking at Saudi Arabia as the end point. We plan on going well beyond that," said the determined Avramovic, a former Yugoslav international. Uzbekistan take on Lebanon in Beirut in the other Group D match.

However, the heavy downpour has led to waterlogging in some old districts of the Macao Peninsula, where people have to wade across the streets and some shops were forced to close.

Though Merkel's Christian Democrats and its traditional allied parties are still leading in polls against Schroeder's Social Democrats and the Greens, if the conservatives parties don't manage to gain a 51 percent majority, it could force the Christian Democrats into a "grand coalition" with the Social Democrats. Both Merkel and Schroeder have said they are against such a coalition.

For a time it was the largest bookstore in the Book People, still independently owned, is my favorite bookstore country. I used to browse at Book People when it was near the UT campus and called Grok Books, more years ago than I care to admit. It's a required stop when in River City, along with Moment on Earth: Today's New Environmentalists and Their Vision before that the couple would be plugging their new book, "This for the Future" at noon on Sunday. As I was headed back home late Sunday morning, at the last minute I whipped my hybrid SUV around and returned to Book People. About 200 people were gathered on the second floor. The Kerrys were about 45 minutes late. Famous people live in different time zones than the rest of us. But the crowd was patient and The Kerrys were relaxed but passionate about their book, which recounts a number of Americans who have taken the lead in grass- root environmental movements, from cleaning up the Hudson River But Kerry, who has been active in pro-environmental reform since participating in the first Earth Day in 1970, became serious when talking about the threat posed by greenhouse gases and global warming. I'm paraphrasing, but he said that scientists have established it's an overwhelming certainty that global warming is real. The United States invaded Iraq on the 1-percent chance that country might pose a direct threat to us, he said, but its leaders are still dithering over whether global warming is a genuine threat. a 99 percent chance that these results are true. So what are we Virtual certainty, in scientific terms, means there is more than arguing about? It's time to quit talking and start walking the talk. That was the crux of Kerry's message. It's what the CEO of our company is preaching, in pushing for an additional 20-percent decrease in carbon-dioxide emissions in our company within a decade, after already cutting those emissions by 10 percent since 2000. Through financial incentives, the folks for whom I work are encouraging people to drive more fuel-efficient vehicles. You can keep your gas hog, but it will affect your car allowance, if you get one. And we managers have been charged with trying to figure out how to use less energy, burn less fuel, work greener and be smarter about using these precious resources. individuals as well, I believe. I fully realize everybody can't Those are the types of steps that must be taken by all of us as go out and buy a hybrid tomorrow. Some people need a bigger vehicle, to pull cattle trailers or whatever. Some of us can't afford it. But a lot of us can scale down. If we don't all start thinking about the carbon footprint that each of us is leaving on this planet, instead of waiting around for government to solve the problem, the consequences will be I'm a late convert to this realization, but I'm an enthusiastic one.

The school has long argued that admitting so many students under a single criteria forces it to "We've talked pretty regularly about trying to put some kind of cap on it. Last year our incoming freshman class was 71 percent out of the top 10 percent," said UT spokesman Don Hale. That House Bill 1186 sponsored by House Higher Education Committee Chairwoman Geanie Morrison, R-Victoria, would likely result in UT Austin accepting the top 7 percent of applicants, said Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, author of the Senate's companion "The argument about top 10 percent is no longer an argument for bringing minorities into the system," Shapiro said, noting the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 ruled affirmative action can be used "Paying out of state tuition is highly undesirable," said Wakeman, who graduated from high school with a 92 average and got an academic scholarship to OU.

CONTEXT	"It's a political hot potato," said Jorge Godinho, a law  professor at the University of Macau. Financiers backing Macau's casino-led economic boom are warning of dark clouds ahead unless steps are taken to end a labour crisis that has forced wages to double in three years. The problem has already forced a number of older casinos to close down gaming tables after their staff were poached by a rash of new establishments that have opened in recent years. biggest ever street demonstration on May Day to protest the They are already planning to hold what is likely to be Macau's proposal, and officials fear that with civil servants on the unions' side, a punishing strike could follow. "The government must strike a balance between the needs of foreign investors and the concerns of the local population. The government is under pressure and it is mounting by the day," Godinho told a conference of foreign investors and local businessmen. The problem has been brought about by Macau's sudden economic surge following the deregulation of its gaming laws in 2001. The move, which came soon after sovereignty of the former Portuguese enclave reverted to Chinese rule in 1999, brought in a flood of overseas -- mostly American -- capital. So far, some 25 billion US dollars have been committed to the city, resulting in the development of dozens of American-styled casino-hotels that have regenerated the city's century-old gaming industry and boosted local coffers. That coincided with a relaxation of travel restrictions on mainland Chinese that brought in a huge wave of tourists -- a record 19 million last year alone. It has also seen Macau's gambling earnings surpass those of the casinos on Las Vegas' famous strip. The crunch has come in the labour market: some 100,000 new jobs are expected to be created in a city with a workforce of only 250,000 and unemployment at just 3 percent. "It's an important issue from the financing point of view because rising wages makes it hard for new developments to accurately project their costs and pricing," said Jonathan Skadden, partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher and Flom, which has helped bring investors into some of the giant new casinos and hotels. Government officials say they are confident that they can find a way around the problem, but financiers say it will take time. to rise again, would you be wanting the government to do anything "If your wages had doubled in three years and were looking likely about it?" asked Roger Suyama, president director of investment bank Merrill Lynch's Indonesian operations and a keen observer of the gaming industry.

CONTEXT	 OUTDOORS: The Department of Conservation visitors centers offer information on walking, mountain biking, fishing and other activities in national parks and forests, and can help plan Walking -- but not roughing it -- in the beauties of New Zealand ' s South Island Part of it is how easy it is to vacation here for a woman traveling alone. It's safe, tourist-friendly and comparatively cheap for anyone coming from North America or Western Europe. turquoise sea wash up on the pure sand beach that fringes dark But mostly it's for moments like these: watching the bright green rainforest. The soundtrack is the insistent chirping of crickets. I'm alone in the world, and I'm only 20 minutes' walk from where I left my car. It's no overstatement: The coast of the Abel Tasman National Park has to be one of the most beautiful places in the world. Though there were plenty of serious hikers around, loaded down with tents and sleeping bags, I chose a few creature comforts -- I mostly stuck to walks I could complete in a day, and I had a Water taxis take day-trippers to points along the Abel Tasman coast, where they can walk part of the coastal track or simply relax on the beach. For a one-day taste of paradise, park in Marahau and take a water taxi to Anchorage Beach; the walk back will take about 3 1/2 hours, leaving plenty of time for swimming, sunbathing and lots of photography along the way. Driving in New Zealand is easy. It's hard to get lost and there's no danger of traffic jams. But distances are deceptive, as roads can be twisty and steep. To get to all corners of the South Island, allow three to four weeks, but the main sights can easily High on most travelers' lists is Queenstown, "Lord of the Rings" territory and the winter skiing center. It's a lakeside town surrounded by stunning mountains, with a host of activities for both the intrepid and the less adventurous, and plenty of souvenir shopping if you happen to arrive there on one of the many rainy days. It's also the gateway to the southwestern Fiordland region, where lush tree-covered mountains rise straight up out of the smooth waters. Author Rudyard Kipling called Milford Sound the eighth wonder of the world, and it's well worth the long detour to take regional center at Te Anau. Many companies also run kayaking a longer bus-and-boat trip to Doubtful or Dusky Sound from the trips into the sounds, and the Milford Track, one of New Zealand's great tramps, starts from nearby. west coast. But to get close to it also requires a detour, from piercer" to indigenous Maori), is visible from locations on the the eastern side of the island. The South Island's central regions are continually surprising -- by turns wide plateaus and river valleys, arid moonscapes and rolling green hills. Though the village of Mount Cook itself is something of a manufactured tourist trap, the journey is worth it for the multitude of walks that start there, and for the very beautiful Lake Pukaki that reflects the peaks of the Southern Alps in its still, pale blue waters. Less visited but no less beautiful is the Catlins region, in the south of the island, between Dunedin and Invercargill, where lush green hills and fern-filled forests rise over deserted golden beaches. According to Maori legend, the South Island was formed from an upturned canoe. The anchor stone of that canoe became Stewart Island, an hour's ferry ride across the Fouveaux Strait from the southern tip of the mainland to Oban, the only community on the island. The rest of Stewart Island is wilderness, a haven for wildlife and walkers. The entire island forms the Rakiura National Park. Stewart Island is the one place in New Zealand where visitors may get a daytime glimpse of the country's elusive national icon, the kiwi, which elsewhere is a nocturnal bird. At night here, it is possible to see the aurora australis, a phenomenon otherwise Point seal colony is a roadside stop on the main east coast road and one that doesn't necessarily require much effort. The Ohau north of Kaikoura; a five-minute walk to a hide in the early evening allows visitors to watch endangered yellow-eyed penguins coming in from the sea near Kaka Point, in the Catlins; and sea there less than 20 years ago. It's now a mecca for viewing -- or village until Maori entrepreneurs set up a whale-watching tour swimming with -- a wide variety of marine life. The Otago Peninsula, on the edge of Dunedin, also offers the chance to see royal albatrosses and many other forms of wildlife. The city of Dunedin fancies itself Scottish, while Christchurch, the biggest city on the South Island, has a decidedly English feel, right down to the men in straw boaters navigating punts The beautiful Banks Peninsula, just outside Christchurch, is the day-trip of choice for residents of that city, with most heading for Akaroa, a town that plays heavily on its short-lived French colonial past. But undiluted Kiwi urban life, such as it is, well, that's best experienced in the laid-back, affluent town of Nelson, in the north of the island. What's more, from here, it's an hour's drive west to the wonders of the Abel Tasman park, or south to the something a little more adventurous, two hours from Nelson gets And if all those day walks make you think you could take on you to Picton, at the northern tip of the island (the ferry leaves for the North Island from here), the start point for the most accessible of the multi-day tramps. A water taxi takes walkers to the start of the Queen Charlotte Track, on the Marlborough Sounds, and then transfers their packs each day to their hotel, hostel or campsite, leaving them to walk Though hundreds of people walk the track every day, because they all go in the same direction, walkers rarely bump in to each other. Like almost everything else in New Zealand, I felt like from Christchurch Airport. Local companies, mostly based GETTING AROUND: Major international car rental companies operate downtown, offer cheaper options on slightly older vehicles. Numerous companies also offer motorhome rentals, an increasingly popular alternative to motels.

Holiday parks usually LODGING: Almost all New Zealand motel units have full kitchens; offer camping, RV parking and motel units. Especially on the west coast, travelers are advised to book accommodations ahead during the peak Christmas-March season. INDOORS: The official network of visitors centers, known as i-Sites, provide information on activities, accommodation and transport across the South Island. Christchurch and Dunedin are New Zealand conservation authorities are visitor-conscious. Paths, from 20-minute nature walks to multi-day slogs, are well- marked and well-maintained.

At the age of 31, after nearly eight years in Iranian prisons, subjected to torture and twice taken to the gallows and fitted with a noose, Batebi had fled. him. Not long after his arrival in Erbil in March, the new cell But in Iraq, his former captors had one more chilling message for phone provided by U.N. officials rang. Batebi was shocked to hear the familiar voice of the chief interrogator at one of Iran's notorious prisons. Instead, Batebi, one of Iran's best-known dissidents, received permission to enter the United States. He arrived June 24. when he witnessed a deadly stoning. He rose to fame in 1999, on Iran under its ruling clerics. His alienation began at age 9, appearing on the cover of The Economist magazine holding the bloody T-shirt of a fellow student demonstrator -- an image he first saw when a judge slapped it before him and declared: "You have signed your own death sentence." Finally, after a decade of political combat, he reluctantly decided to abandon Iran for an uncertain exile. Batebi's escape has prompted a paroxysm of denunciation in Iran's controlled news media, which have accused him of defrauding creditors and suggested that he has long been in league with the Depp with a ponytail and a satisfied expression, posing in front photograph that pops up shows the dissident, an Iranian Johnny of the U.S. Capitol. While some details of Batebi's biography, his treatment in Iran and his escape could not be independently confirmed, he provided a video he took during his journey, and independent advocates vouched for much of his account. He knows he has arrived during a time of tension between Iran and the United States, and he said he did not want his story to heighten the conflict. Wary of being viewed as a pawn of U.S. policy, he said that the United States played no role in his departure from Iran, a fact American officials confirmed. The United States did give him permission to enter this country "out of concern for his safety," said Gordon D. Johndroe, the spokesman for the National Security Council. He said Batebi attended a courtesy meeting with NSC Despite Batebi's soft-spoken Farsi, translated by Lily Mazahery, an Iranian-American lawyer who is helping him resettle, his contempt for Iran's rulers is palpable. But he does not want a Batebi may have inherited his jaundiced view of his country's leaders. After the Islamic revolution of 1979, his father, a customs bureaucrat who had fallen out of favor with the shah's His own awakening began in fourth grade, when his teacher, fed up with the distortions of an official history textbook, burst out: "Go out and read other things to try to get the truth." "The teacher probably doesn't even remember," Batebi said. "But he changed the course of my life." A few weeks later came the stoning. Though forbidden by his mother, he slipped out of the house to see the commotion near his school. He saw a man, accused of adultery, buried to the waist, his head covered with a sack that turned red as Revolutionary Guards hurled chunks of concrete. A mullah standing atop a wall gave the orders, and an ambivalent crowd of neighbors looked on. Years later, he would witness public hangings and dismemberments. "But nothing had the impact of that stoning," he said. "I thought, This can't be Islam." The demonstrations exploded in 1999 in what would become known as 18 Tir, as July 8 is known by the Iranian calendar. In a wave of protests that threatened the 20-year-old regime, hundreds of students demonstrated against the closing of a newspaper, Salam. When the police fired into a crowd, a bullet hit a young man next to Batebi, who pulled off the student's shirt to try to stanch the bleeding. After carrying the wounded man to a makeshift clinic, he held up the shirt to warn other students against and kicked in his teeth, he said. They held his face down in a His jailers thrashed him with a metal cable, beat his testicles pool of excrement. They tied his arms behind his back and hung him from the ceiling. At other times, strapping him to a chair, they kept him awake night after night, cutting him and rubbing To stave off madness, he said, he fought back.

Peering over bluffs, the group could see the flags of two nations facing one another at lonely border posts. "Suddenly I was very scared," he said. "I was like a baby who's been separated from his mother and has stepped into a world of which he knows nothing." His protectors brought him to the Erbil offices of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which began the laborious process necessary to move an Iranian with no passport and little Javadi.

CONTEXT	 Why two state agencies _ the Health Department and the attorney general's office _ would have contradictory assessments of the same program is unclear. But internal Health Department records, as well as interviews with current and former officials, suggest that the doors of senior health officials were always open to Friedman and that officials felt pressured to approve his requests with haste. Agency documents show, for example, that the department gave Friedman formal approval for expanding to three shifts a day 10 months after Parkshore informed officials that it was already running the three Officials for the Adult Day Health Care Council, the statewide industry group, say that the expansion of shifts always required state approval. But the Health Department said that before new regulations _ instituted after Friedman's indictment _ the agency was merely ``notified of changes in shifts through written correspondence'' from day care centers. In the course of securing approval for their continued expansion _ and fighting the occasional rejection of their requests _ Parkshore representatives made several visits to Albany to meet with Health Department officials. On March 18, 1998, Friedman and his administrator, Marilyn Reiter, visited the office of Chiseri, the deputy commissioner for administration. Under the agency's structure of responsibility, health officials say, Chiseri would oversee personnel and therefore have no role in the application process. It is unclear what the meeting was about; Reiter could not be reached for comment, and Chiseri declined to comment. Friedman would not agree to be interviewed. What is known is that within two weeks, the Health Department approved Friedman's request to expand his center's capacity to 200 clients from 100, and had received yet another Parkshore request: to open a second day care center in Brooklyn. In April 1998, the attorney general's office notified the Health Department that Parkshore's operations were under scrutiny, an investigation triggered by reports that clients were bragging about gold watches and cash payments. The Health Department, however, said that such notifications were commonplace and that the attorney general's office did not ask the agency at that time to restrict senior health officials were trying to push through Friedman's And so it did not. In fact, internal correspondence suggests that applications for further expansion, despite the warnings of midlevel employees. In November 1998, the Health Department notified Parkshore that its request to open a second center had been approved: three shifts a day, 100 clients a shift, doors open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., seven days a As Parkshore grew, however, so did the scope of the criminal investigation. Last March, a grand jury in Brooklyn began to hear testimony: of medical records falsified to make clients appear sicker; Last November, the Health Department notified Friedman by letter that Parkshore had once again passed the agency's inspection, and was in compliance with state and federal requirements. The letter added: The next month, Friedman was arrested and charged in a 21-count indictment. services not provided; of clients who were not eligible _ that is, too of lucrative ambulette service provided unnecessarily to clients; of healthy _ to be enrolled in a medical-based program.

The found nearly 3,000 donations to Obama from more than a dozen contributions represent a tiny fraction of the record $450 million Obama has raised. But the obviously questionable donations -- some donors simply entered gibberish for their names -- raise questions about whether the Obama campaign is adequately vetting its unprecedented flood of donors. There is no evidence that questionable contributions amount to anything more than a small portion of Obama's fundraising haul. The Times' analysis, conducted over just a few days and looking for obvious anomalies, like names with all consonants, identified about $40,000 in contributions from people that appeared not to exist. And these donations had not been refunded by the campaign as of its last filing with the Federal Election Commission in contain far fewer obviously fake names, although he has also It appears that campaign finance records for Sen. John McCain taken in about $200 million in contributions, less than half Obama's total. Although campaigns have long wrestled to some degree with questionable donations, Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, said the record-setting number of new donors Obama has drawn, many of them online, She pointed out, however, that it would take an extraordinary amount of coordination to pull off widespread fraud. more than 2.5 million donors it has had to wade through and said: Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, highlighted the "We have been aggressive about taking every available step to make sure our contributions are appropriate, updating our systems when necessary."

In some cases, campaign finance records showed some refunds from the Obama campaign, even as other contributions were accepted. Obama officials said most of their vetting occurs after the donation comes in. Officials with campaign finance watchdog groups said there is no proof yet that the problem is widespread, but they said the issue certainly warrants additional scrutiny. "I think the candidates need to be clearer about the vetting systems they're using and demonstrating they're sufficient to weed out potential fraud," said Stephen Weissman, associate director for policy at the Campaign Finance Institute. bolstering the contentions of some campaign finance groups that appear to have been given in small increments online, are additional disclosure requirements are needed for contributions that fall below $200. Federal candidates are not required to itemize contributions below $200 to the FEC unless the donor's cumulative total adds up to more than $200. Roughly 70 percent of the contributions to Newsmax.com, that highlighted thousands of dollars in The complaint followed an article on the conservative web site, contributions made in increments of $25 dating back to March, from "Good Will" in Austin, Texas, whose employer was listed as "Loving" and his occupation as "You," as well as thousands in small contributions that started last November from a "Doodad Pro" in Nunda, NY with the same employer and occupation.

"The personnel announced today have the proven skill sets to ensure that the Lions squad is well prepared for the tour to South Africa next year."

Peri Drysdale is the founder of New Zealand fashion label Untouched World, which has an emphasis on environmentally sustainable products and has won fans in the Clintons and Drysdale is one of the pioneers of blending possum fur with merino, knitting her first garment from the blend in 1992 and first selling it commercially in 1996. "The thing we really like about it is it creates a light, luxurious, beautifully soft garment and unusually for a very fine textile it has very good long wearing qualities," Drysdale told AFP. The product is unique and Drysdale's Snowy Peak and Untouched World companies are among a rising number of New Zealand firms making products under names such as merinomink, eco-possum, possumdown, eco fur and possum wool. Sales of merino-and-possum-blend knitwear and accessories such as socks, scarves and gloves have grown rapidly and account for about 95 percent of all commercially caught possum fur.

Industry figures say most criticism over possum dissipates when critics become aware of the facts about the environmental damage done by possums in New Zealand. Brushtailed possums were first introduced to New Zealand in 1837 from their native Australia in hopes of starting a fur industry, and their numbers have exploded in the absence of predators. Numbers of many native New Zealand birds including the iconic flightless kiwi are falling fast and they could be doomed to extinction in the wild unless possums and other pests including Zealand's beef, dairy and venison exports. Animal health and Possums also spread bovine tuberculosis, threatening New conservation authorities spend many millions of dollars each year on trapping and poisoning campaigns to try to control the pest.

But he says conservation authorities are happy to work with the fur industry and don't want any conflict.

CONTEXT	 They're Having Babies. Are We Helping? The girls gather in small groups outside suburban T.C. Williams High School most mornings, standing with their babies on their hips, talking and giggling like sorority sisters. Sometimes their mothers drop the kids (and their kids) off with a carefree smile and a wave. As I watch the girls carry their children into the day-care center in our new school building, I can't help OK, I'm an old guy from the 1950s. But even in these less censorious times, I'm amazed -- and concerned -- by the apparently nonchalant attitude these girls and their mothers exhibit daily. Last I heard, teen mothers are still a major concern: They're less likely to finish school and more likely to live in poverty; their children are more likely to have difficulties in school and with the law; and on and on. But none of that seems to register. "Some girls seem to be really into it," says T.C. senior Mary Ball. "They are embracing their pregnancies." Nor is the sight of a pregnant classmate much of a surprise anymore. "When I was in middle school, I'd be shocked to see a pregnant eighth-grader," says Ball. "Now it seems so ordinary Teenage pregnancy has been bright on American radar screens for the past year: TV teen starlet Jamie Lynn Spears's pregnancy caused a minor media storm last December, and the pregnant-teen movie "Juno" won Oscar nods. Bristol Palin, daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, brought the issue front and center during the recent presidential campaign. But the picture I see is more troubling than any of those high-profile pregnancies make it The somber statistics about teen motherhood are the reason the day-care center was opened in T.C. Williams two years ago. The idea is to keep the girls in school and let them get their diplomas. I want to help my students succeed in every way possible, and I know these girls need support. But I can't help thinking we're going at this all wrong. On the surface, suburban Alexandria, Va., seems to be striving to stem teen pregnancy. Every high school student must take a "family life" course that teaches about birth control, sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy. Near the school is the Adolescent Health Center, which provides birth control. The Campaign on Adolescent Pregnancy sponsors workshops for parents But none of this hits teens with the message that getting pregnant is a disaster. And within the school, it's if teachers and administrators are afraid to address the issue for fear of Once a girl gets pregnant, the school leaps in to do everything for her. But is it possible that all this assistance -- with little or no comment about the kids' actions -- is making it easier for girls to make a bad choice and help them avoid the truth about the consequences? And for many, it does seem to be a choice. "There's a myth that these pregnancies are accidental," says school nurse Nancy Runton. "But many of them aren't. I've known girls who've made `I'll get pregnant if you get pregnant' pacts. It's a status thing. These girls go around school telling each other how beautiful they look pregnant, how cute their tummies look." Nationally, the birth rate among teens, after falling 36 percent since 1990, went up 3 percent in 2006, the first increase in 15 years -- mostly due to pregnancies among Hispanics. Sarah Brown, director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, said Hispanics now have the nation's highest rate of teen pregnancy and births of any racial or ethnic group. In our school of 2,211 students, at least 70 girls students are soon-to-be or already mothers. Social worker Terri Wright says that for many girls, getting pregnant before they turn 18 is a rite of passage. "They don't wear sweatshirts or baggy dresses to conceal their pregnancies," says Wright. "I get invitations to baby showers. Girls bring me pictures of their kids dressed up like little dolls." "There is zero shame," agrees school nurse Runton. One girl walked into a colleague's class, announced that she was pregnant and began showing her sonogram around. Another proudly proclaimed that she was "going on maternity leave." The teacher tried to explain that maternity leave is a job benefit that doesn't apply to high school students. The pregnant teens' classmates don't necessarily applaud the phenomenon, either. "These girls having babies are living in a dream world," says Lauren Heming, a senior in my AP English class. "They think that because the school is giving them all this help now, things will be easy for them when they graduate." Many girls are under "great pressure to grow up fast by having sex," senior Kayla Tall says. "A lot of girls think that if they have the baby, they can keep hanging on to the boyfriend. In fact, these guys are little boys who have used the girls to prove themselves to each other." Still, I can't begrudge someone like Cynthia Quinteros, 16, the help she needs to raise her one-year-old son. "If it wasn't for the day-care center, I would have to quit school to take care of Angel," she says. "My mother is a single mom, and my brother is 11. My mom has to work." dresses Angel, and is at school by 7:50, dropping Angel off at Cynthia's days are grueling. She gets up at 6 a.m., feeds and the center. Her mom picks them both up at 3:15 p.m. At home, Cynthia eats, plays with Angel, starts homework and then leaves at 4:50 for her supermarket cashier's job. She gets home at Cynthia says she wasn't trying to get pregnant: Since she was 13, she got a shot of the contraceptive DMPA/Depo-Provera every three months at the teen health clinic. Cynthia would tell her mom that she had to stay after school and then go to the clinic, but when her mother insisted she come home right away, she missed her shots and got pregnant at 15. She says that all her friends who have babies wish they had waited. "They've learned the hard way," she says. "None of them want to have another baby now." Most of the mothers are in free and reduced school-lunch programs and have no insurance. So when they get pregnant, a whole tax- supported industry kicks into action: The Health Department assigns a nurse to the girl, a group called Resource Mothers is notified to pick girls up at school or home and drive them to doctor's appointments, and day care is planned for the child. The school dietitian plans nutritious meals for the mothers. The federally funded WIC program provides free formula, milk, cheese, peanut butter and the like to the teens and their babies. In According to a study by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, teen childbearing nationwide cost taxpayers $9.1 billion in 2004. Teens 17 and under account for $8.6 billion of that total, or an average of $4,080 per teen mother annually. It's hard to say whether other school districts do any better at discouraging teen pregnancy. According to Brown, school sex-ed programs nationwide are a patchwork that includes everything from Cynthia Quinteros, however, has a theory. "I feel that the community is afraid to talk about all the girls who are getting pregnant," she says. "Once you get pregnant, they do everything for you, but they ought to be doing all they can do to show girls how difficult their lives will be if they have a baby. I love Angel, but if I didn't have him I wouldn't have to work after Out of the mouths of babes. and teens.

"I'm not participating in this exercise ... so I can propose something that will go nowhere," he told the state Medical Society. "We want to do something that will have a real impact ... to deal with this issue in a way that alleviates the pain Hours later, patients' rights advocates accused the second-year governor of excluding them from the talks. "We've been shut out of this process for the large part," said Joanne Doroshow of the Center for Justice & Democracy. She and Arthur Levin of the Center for Medical Consumers are members of a task force appointed by Spitzer to study medical liability. Both said they knew nothing about the legislative The pair also described as "myths" the assertions of Spitzer and the Medical Society that the high cost of malpractice insurance was driving doctors out of the state, causing shortages in obstetrics and other specialties, and threatening insurers with insolvency because of large damage awards. The task force was created in July when the Insurance Department approved a 14 percent hike in malpractice premiums. The increase jolted doctors, coming after the stable rates of Gov. George Spitzer blamed Pataki on Tuesday for precipitating a crisis by artificially keeping down the cost of malpractice coverage while damage awards continued to soar. A 2006 report found the average award rose from $6 million to $8.1 million between 1999 and 2005. Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno called for action to help doctors, saying the exodus had to stop. While Spitzer gave no details of his plan, internist Herb Ausubel of Valley Stream applauded the effort.

CONTEXT	 Indian PM's communist allies reject landmark US nuke deal Key communist allies of India's coalition government rejected a civilian nuclear deal with the United States on Tuesday, warning Prime Minister Manmohan Singh against pushing ahead. A group of communist parties that support the Congress party-led coalition asked Singh not to go ahead with the complex deal known as the 123 agreement because it requires several steps in tandem provisions that cannot be accepted by any country that loves its "Our party has stated very clearly that the accord contains sovereignty," Prakash Karat, chief of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) told reporters. The communist said they were unable to accept the pact after careful assessment of the text, released on Friday, in the "context of (a) burgeoning strategic alliance" with Washington. Within minutes of the Communists rejecting the deal, former Hindu nationalist foreign minister Yashwant Sinha, voiced his party's opposition, saying the accord would jeopardise India's nuclear Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said the government would talk to the Communists. Politicial analyst Rasheed Kidwai said the Communists' objections to the deal put Singh and his government in a spot. After the Hindu nationalists made it clear they will oppose the deal, the Communists will be compelled to support them against the government or risk being labelled inconsistent, he said. beginning Monday, in which the deal is also expected to run into The statement came ahead of India's monsoon session of parliament criticism from the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. weapons programme as well as restricting its foreign policy Though the government rejected the Hindu nationalists' demand for a multi-party parliamentary committee to examine the deal, Sinha said his party  "will raise this issue strongly in parliament and try to convince and compel the government to accept (it)." Singh, who personally oversaw two years of talks that led to the historic pact, is expected to make a statement in parliament on August 13. The terms of the accord, which seeks to bring India into the loop of global nuclear commerce after a gap of three decades, were also rejected by India's main opposition Hindu nationalists over One of the trickiest issues -- whether India's unilateral decision to test nuclear weapons would end the deal -- appeared to have been sidestepped. The deal must also be approved by the US Congress and other nations under the umbrella of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. "The nuclear deal has been touted by the government as one of its greatest triumphs with Singh himself taking a lot of interest in this. "A lot of hard work had gone into this and now when it is nearly done, the government's allies are opposing it," Kidwai said. "Such a move will make it untenable for the government to continue in office," he added. The deal clinched in Washington last month allows India to buy civilian nuclear technology while possessing nuclear weapons, making it an exception under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation National Security Adviser M.K. Narayananan last month described the deal as "excellent" and India's atomic energy board chief, Anil Kakodkar, added that he was satisfied with it. options.

CONTEXT	 RugbyU: McGeechan returns to the Lions den Ian McGeechan was on Wednesday unveiled as manager for the British and Lions 2009 tour to South Africa. It will be the fourth time the 61-year-old Scot has led the Lions and it was under his stewardship that they scored a famous series victory over the Springboks in 1997. McGeechan, currently director of rugby at English giants Wasps, was involved with the 1974 and 1977 tours as a player, then in 2005 as assistant coach and 1987, 1993 and 1997 as head coach. South Africa's World Cup-winning coach Jake White had expressed an interest in the job but the momentum behind McGeechan's appointment soon took over. Lions chairman Andy Irvine said: "A Lions tour is very special - even in the modern game they're as popular as ever. "Some years ago there was doubt they would even continue but I'm delighted to say they're as popular as ever," the former Scotland and Lions full-back added. "Many players have said playing for the Lions is the highlight of their career. And we expect 50,000 fans to travel South Africa. "The 2005 tour was very disappointing as we lost the Test series 3-0 so it's vital we have the best leadership for to achieve success in South Africa. "Once Gerald Davies was appointed tour manager all our attentions focused on who would be the best coach. From day one McGeechan was in our thoughts. "We wanted someone with a special bond with the Lions. We looked elsewhere as well but time and again we kept going back to Ian. "He's the most successful coach in Lions history." Former Scotland international Alan Tait, a member of the victorious 1997 Lions squad in South Africa coached by McGeechan, told Sky Sports: "The Lions just goes with his name. The Wales coach Warren Gatland and his longstanding assistant Shaun Edwards are favourites to join the Lions' coaching team and McGeechan revealed he will be assembling his back room staff as soon as possible. He said: "Gerald and I will spend some time together and talk things through. "I hope that over the next two months the management structure will be in place. From now we'll be working very hard in that respect." Wales hero Davies, widely regarded as one of the best wings in rugby union history, was a key member of the first, and so far only, Lions squad to win a Test series in New Zealand back in The Lions have 10 matches scheduled in South Africa, including Tests against the Springboks in Durban, Pretoria and Johannesburg between June 20 and July 4. Other fixtures include appointments with the Emerging Springboks, Western Province and the Sharks and the tour opens on May 30 against a Highveld XV in Rustenburg. enthusiasm is still going strong. 1971.

Kohl has not addresssed a CDU congress since 1999, when he admitted to running illegal secret funds while chancellor between 1982 and 1998. CDU legislator Andreas Schmidt told reporters afterwards that Kohl's "life accomplishment (as chancellor of German unity) had benefitted both the party and the country. Kohl embodies this accomplishment." A spokesman for the Berlin court said Wednesday it had ruled that a political party was responsible for its bookkeeping and that the CDU had violated German law in failing to report any campaign contributions of more than 10,000 euros. Parliament speaker Wolfgang Thierse imposed a 21 million euro fine on the CDU in February 2000. The CDU can appeal the decision to a higher court. He also called on the CDU to look towards unifying Europe. "The gift of (German) unification obligates us to do this," Kohl said. Stoiber will address the congress on its final day Tuesday, when the CDU adopts a joint campaign platform with its sister party, the Christian Social Union which is only filing candidates in Bavaria.

Black smoke rose above the city center, mingling with clouds of tear gas. Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, whose increasingly unpopular government has already faced a growing number of sometimes violent demonstrations in recent months, called an emergency Cabinet meeting Monday night. in central Syntagma Square. As the hooded youths moved on, some In Athens, rioters torched the capital's massive Christmas tree protesters posed for photos in front of the blaze, and others sang the Greek version of "O Christmas Tree." The windows of two of Athens' luxury hotels, the Athens Plaza and the Grande Bretagne on Syntagma Square, were smashed. A hotel guard at the Athens Plaza said its guests had been evacuated. A lone man with a bucket of water struggled to extinguish a fire in the ground floor of the Foreign Ministry, opposite Parliament. Fires were also reported in the building of an airline and a Greek bank, as well as in tens of other stores in most of Athens' major central streets. Scenes of destruction also unfolded in Thessaloniki, where hundreds of masked and hooded youths hurled rocks and molotov cocktails at storefronts and riot police, who responded with tear The fire departments of both cities rushed to respond to the widespread destruction. In Athens, rioters surrounded one small fire truck as it tried to extinguish a blaze, smashing the Greek media also reported fires and destruction in the central city of Larissa. Massive riots first erupted Saturday across the country, from Thessaloniki in the north to the island of Crete in the south, after 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos was fatally shot by a police officer in Athens' often volatile Exarchia district. The circumstances surrounding the shooting are unclear, but the two officers involved have been arrested; one has been charged with murder and the other as an accomplice. A coroner's report shows the boy was shot in the chest. The Police Officers' Association has apologized to the boy's family, and President Karolos Papoulias sent a telegram to his parents expressing his condolences. "All the dangerous and unacceptable events that occurred because of the emotions that followed the tragic incident cannot and will not be tolerated," Karamanlis said in a live televised address Monday morning. "The state will protect society." But his calls for calm went unheeded and the scenes of destruction are likely to further dent the government's popularity. In an outpouring of rage, high school and university students join self-styled anarchists in throwing everything from fruit and coins to rocks and Molotov cocktails at police and attacked a Christmas spirit in the market," said Vassilis Krokidis, head "It comes at a time when we have been trying so hard to establish of the Piraeus Traders' Association. "Our challenge remains getting through the economic crisis and saving the jobs of those who work in regular businesses." Although there is little public support for street violence or wanton destruction of property, there is a deep well of tolerance for demonstrations in Greece, where the right to protest is held dear. Violence often breaks out between riot police and anarchists during demonstrations.

CONTEXT	in their 20s, worked on the technology while Camp pursued his The founders, Garrett Camp, Geoff Smith and Justin LaFrance, all master's degree at the University of Calgary. Camp had been best friends with Smith's roommate, and Smith, who hailed from Victoria, had met LaFrance in high school at a technology camp.  Camp recalls attending a conference at Stanford University, and then Smith took him to dinner. "In two weeks, I met six people, and every single person was interested" in investing, he said. Most fittingly of all, it describes how the founders ultimately left their sleepy origins in the Canadian Rockies and stumbled into the white-hot center of the latest technology boom. After toiling in obscurity for four years, the founders pulled together an A-list of Silicon Valley investors in late 2005, moved to San Francisco in early 2006, and rode the Web 2.0 wave to success. Last month they sold their 14-person company to eBay "The entire nature of StumbleUpon technology is based on serendipity, and the entire history of the company has been a series of fortuitous, serendipitous coincidences that mirror the difficult to grasp, something about the 'pay-it-forward' goodwill founders. "There is something going on at a higher order that is nature of it." In the ashes of the dot-com bust, when jobs were scarce, they had an idea to start something: Give people a button to click, and they'll find something interesting. Smith was what Camp called books as you have also bought other books you might like. In engine, the one that tells you that people who like the same addition, Camp said in one of several interviews conducted over the past year, the Web has become so vast that it is nearly impossible to surf, the way a television viewer can just click on In its early years, StumbleUpon attracted a following by word of mouth. By early 2005, it had 50,000 users. One was O'Neill. technology enthusiast who recognizes pathbreaking developments, Group, a consulting firm in the Boston area. But he is also a and he instantly recognized the potential of StumbleUpon. "I became an active Stumbler, and befriended Geoff and Garrett and Justin," he said. They now refer to him as "Uncle Brad." He questioned them about their business, expecting to find that they had terabytes of storage -- huge amounts, which often present a challenge for small tech firms that try to grow. When O'Neill heard that they had a relatively paltry 80 gigabytes, he in Philadelphia; and Ariel Poler, who founded LinkExchange, which now runs First Round Capital, an early stage venture capital fund was sold to Microsoft, Topica and several other Internet startups. "I was blown away by the level of traction that these guys had without any marketing budget," Kopelman said. "And they were outside the (Silicon Valley) ecosystem. They built it without the benefit of relationships or history or partnerships or experience that you typically think is required to get that type of traction." Other investors followed: Ram Shriram, a former Netscape and Amazon executive who sits on the Google board of directors; Ron Conway, a widely known angel investor; and Rajeev Motwani, a Stanford professor and early Google adviser. The total round was less than $2 million, giving further proof to the Web 2.0 maxim about the low barrier to building something big on the Internet. And StumbleUpon was making money right out of The number of registered Stumblers exploded in 2005, rising to almost 1 million, Camp said. But there were disadvantages as well. "It's not the same kind of culture for technology," Camp said. "There's wireless, and there's oil and gas and environmental technologies." Still, there was hope for Web 2.0 ideas coming out of Canada. Stewart Butterfield and Caterina Fake started Flickr in Vancouver, eventually selling it to Yahoo and moving to San Camp and Smith moved to San Francisco, as well, while LaFrance stayed in Canada. Camp started working out of his South of Market apartment in January 2006. O'Neill put the team on his personal Verizon wireless plan. The company moved to a one-room office at Fourth and Market streets, then to 1,000 square feet on New Montgomery Street, and then to even larger digs above 111 Minna St., the Web 2.0 party The company also hired Dave Feller as vice president of marketing. Feller had worked with Kopelman at Half.com, and stayed on at eBay for six years. The founding team, not the investors, deserve all the credit, Kopelman said: "I don't think this is a story of, 'Look at these great investors and how they took three naive ducklings and made them into a company.' These guys really built something. We helped around the edges. This is story of how working very hard and building a community over years can build value. "I don't think I had to educate them much. These guys are very sharp. They did not have a significant amount of corporate experience, but they understood what their users wanted." expand the company or seek a buyer. Many venture capitalists Kopelman did say the board had many discussions about whether to wanted a piece of the action "at an attractive valuation," Kopelman said. O'Neill referred to the pitches as "over-eager capital from our friends on Sand Hill Road." The company had to choose between two classic Silicon Valley paths, O'Neill said: "You can grow and become a profitable business, and you may or may not have an IPO exit. Or you can build a company and hope to seek a home for it in an acquiring Michael Buhr to serve as StumbleUpon's general manager, working In announcing the deal on May 30, eBay appointed its executive in the San Francisco office. "I'm not at all concerned about that with these guys," O'Neill said. "I lived through the first round of this. I've seen what happens when arrogance takes hold. The 'I'm so special' syndrome takes over. In final days of negotiating this deal (with eBay), I would give them updates of where we were, and they would say, 'OK, great, can we go back to work?' Calgary had some advantages for the team, he said. "It's pretty cheap in Canada." Camp said the move to San Francisco "accelerated change." In Calgary, "Months would go on and no one knew what I was doing." In fact, he said, "I'm not sure we knew exactly what we were doing."

CONTEXT	 The Nigeria Football Association (NFA) has charged the senior national team, Super Eagles to record a clean sweep of victories in the four World Cup qualifiers holding in June. The Eagles are to play a friendly match against Austrian national team on Tuesday in Graz, Austria and their South Africa counterpart, Bafana Bafana on June 1 at the National Stadium, Secretary General of the NFA, Bolaji Ojo-Oba, said the association had told the players to go for the 12 points at stake next month, adding that the friendly match with Austria was aimed at getting the team ready for the challenges ahead. He said the best way to move easily to the next round of the qualifiers was to attain an unassailable lead in the busy month of June. "We expect victories in all our games in June. That is the target and we have told our players to achieve it. We are trying to avoid any case of being in a tight situation and also depending on another match to move on in the competition," he said. "The competition is in its early stage but anything can happen anytime. The new coaching crew is also working hard to return the team to winning ways after what happened in Ghana," he added. According to him, Nigeria failed to qualify for the Germany 2006 World Cup and that is why the country has to double its efforts this time in all areas.

CONTEXT	Three other nephews died tragically - John F. Kennedy Jr. in a  plane crash, Michael Kennedy in a skiing accident, and David Kennedy from a drug overdose. Two of Edward Kennedy's children, Edward Jr. and Kara, are cancer survivors. KENNEDY DIAGNOSIS SENDS SHOCKWAVES ACROSS U.S. US Senator Edward M. Kennedy has been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, his doctors said Tuesday, and the prognosis appears uncertain at best for the last surviving brother of the famed Kennedy clan, who has been an enormous force in American politics for nearly half a century. The announcement was made three days after Kennedy, 76, was stricken at the family's Hyannis Port compound. Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted a battery of tests, forms of radiation and chemotherapy," said the statement by Dr. "The usual course of treatment includes combinations of various Lee Schwamm, a neurologist, and Dr. Larry Ronan, Kennedy's primary care physician. While his doctors said he will remain at Mass. General "for the next couple of days," Kennedy associates said they expected him to push for his discharge as early as Wednesday. Despite the bad news, a Kennedy associate said that the senator shows no symptoms, remains upbeat, and has warned small groups of aides that he wants them back at work. The associate, who requested anonymity, said Kennedy is plotting his course of treatment as if he were mapping strategy to enact a major piece of legislation, peppering his doctors with questions He has given no thought to retirement, a Kennedy confidante asserted. "It's not even an option." Kennedy's type of cancer, known as a malignant glioma, is the most common kind of brain tumor in his age group. Nationally, about 9,000 such malignancies are diagnosed each year. If Kennedy is unable to serve, a special election to choose a successor would be held between 145 and 160 days after the seat becomes vacant, according to a state law enacted in 2004. Kennedy, the second-longest serving member of the Senate and third-longest serving in its 219-year history, has had a series of health problems over the years.

Kennedy Jr. and US Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, arrived at 9:45 a.m. Kara Kennedy, his daughter, also spent Tuesday at the hospital, as did Kennedy's None of the Kennedys talked to the reporters standing watch outside. Neither the family nor Kennedy's office issued public statements, but late in the day they allowed photographers from the Globe and Associated Press to shoot pictures of Kennedy and members of his family. Bush's spokeswoman, said the president "was deeply saddened and reporters, reaction was broad, swift, and solemn. Dana Perino, would keep Senator Kennedy in his prayers." Kennedy's hospitalization Saturday triggered alarm in the political world and drew an outpouring of support from around the nation. The concern abated when friends and associates said later Since being elected to the Senate in 1962 to the seat vacated by his brother, President Kennedy, Edward Kennedy has sponsored more than 2,500 bills, with nearly a quarter becoming law. He has made a career of championing the causes of the least fortunate. His To Massachusetts, Kennedy has helped bring enormous sums of money for funding medical and other scientific research, infrastructure, historic preservation, and aid for the state's A summary of Kennedy's achievements in the Senate, compiled by his staff, is 50 single-spaced pages long. "That's the trimmed- down version," an aide said recently. During President Bush's administration, Kennedy was an early and consistent critic of the Iraq war, but also an important ally who helped Bush win passage of No Child Left Behind, the education Kennedy is the only one of the four brothers to live through middle age. His three brothers all died prematurely: Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., killed in 1944 on a World War II bombing mission; John F. Kennedy, assassinated in Dallas in 1963; and Robert F. Kennedy, assassinated while campaigning in Los Angeles in 1968. Political success and personal tragedy have marked the story of one of the nation's most famous families. Edward Kennedy's son, Patrick, and nephew Joseph P. Kennedy II became congressmen, and a niece, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, served as lieutenant governor Kennedy has suffered through his own misfortune and failure. In 1964, he suffered a broken back in a small plane crash in Western Massachusetts that resulted in the death of the pilot and one of Kennedy's aides. In 1969, Mary Jo Kopechne drowned when a car driven by Kennedy went off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, and Kennedy left the scene.

Young Americans do need to serve their country. But they our nation needs is a system of compulsory universal civil service for young people. My views on compulsory service have evolved since 1953, when I entered the House of Representatives with universal military service on my agenda. After four years in the Navy during World War II and having seen the effect that the service had on my life and that of other veterans, I thought that we should require all men to serve in the armed forces for one or two years, beginning at age 18. But my thinking changed as the House Defense military manpower needs at low pay rates. Thousands were drafted From 1932 until 1971 the draft made it possible to maintain by the Army for two years and sent to Vietnam with a minimum of training for a one-year tour. In addition to the low pay, the draft was extremely unfair to many young people because of all sponsored and supported the all-volunteer force when I became among other reasons, I moved first to the lottery draft and then secretary of defense. Those who would reinstate the draft to meet the demands of the ``war on terror'' are misguided. The regular forces, National Guard and reserves need only about one out of every 18 young men and women coming of age to fill all of their manpower requirements. In the lifetime of the all-volunteer force, enough young people have enlisted in our military in times of peace and During the past 30 years, even when the pay and benefits of the volunteer military have been lower than in civilian life, our young people have stepped up. Some respond to an inner call to still others are drawn to the adventure, challenge or camaraderie serve; others are motivated by an opportunity for education; of military life. We ask them to risk their lives and put their families aside, but we dishonor them when we take their sacrifice and in return offer stingy paychecks, inadequate equipment and The overuse of reserve and National Guard personnel can be helped if we pay for adequate compensation and medical treatment and if military suffer, but America cannot afford a generation of young people turning away from public service and all that it means. Understandably, some youths do not feel that military service is democracy and, as such, would surely have the side benefit of increasing military enlistments. And those volunteering for the military would be exempt from the required civilian universal I am not blind to the economic impact such an idea would have.

Opening the base to four buses of foreign media was an attempt to show that the secretive Chinese military can be more open to the outside world. As the buses disgorged their load of journalists, a military band snapped to attention, bursting into a rendition of "The PLA March," gold tubas and trumpets glistening in what passes for sun in China's hazy capital.

The foreign television reporters appeared to love this part of the tour, tripping over each other to do stand-up shots in front of the battle scenes.

Strong quake jolts remote islands off New Zealand A 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck the remote Kermadec islands north of New Zealand on Tuesday, the US Geological Survey reported, but experts said there was no risk of a tsunami. The epicentre of the quake, recorded at 6:24 pm (0624 GMT), was 217 kilometres (135 miles) from Raoul Island and at a depth of 35 kilometres. Earthquakes and volcanic activity are common in the Kermadec islands area, which is part of the "Ring of Fire," where the Pacific plate of the earth's crust meets other continental plates. In the past three months, tremors of 7.3, 6.5 and 6.0 have been recorded in the area, 1,000 kilometres north of New Zealand. Two years ago, a conservation worker was killed on Raoul Island when he was caught in a mudflow after a volcano erupted during an earthquake swarm.

While it is difficult to get a true picture of how often inmates suffer assaults from their fellow criminals and by prison staff members, anecdotal evidence shows that the rape is an all-too According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were more than 6,500 inmate allegations of sexual assault reported in 2006 to authorities. That is a rate of 2.9 claims per 1,000 prisoners, an estimate based on a sampling of prison facilities. "Correction officials would argue that the vast majority of these inmate allegations are not sustained. Everyone agrees that prison rape is an issue that needs to be addressed, but not everyone agrees on the scope of the problem," Deitch says. Congress estimates that one million inmates were sexually assaulted, during the 20 years preceding the signing of the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 by President George W. Bush. Authorities, scholars and independent monitors of US prisons hope that the federal law's requirement of mandatory reporting of sexual violence will soon yield more precise statistics. Experts are trying to train corrections officials around the country so there is uniform reporting of data.

The consequences of prison sexual abuse for society include more mental health problems, increased cases of HIV/AIDS, and more violence. Experts say the good news is that more correctional agencies have become "professionalized" in recent years, thanks to internal accountability measures. However, Deitch said, more outside oversight is needed. "The United States is one of the only Western nations that (lack) a comprehensive mechanism for ensuring the routine external monitoring of all correctional facilities," she testified. Outside oversight will not solve the problem of sexual assault in prisons, but will let the public and correctional administrators know if the goal of "safe and humane" correctional facilities is Robert Green, warden of the 1,029-bed Montgomery County Correctional Facility at Boyds, Maryland says prison sexual violence must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted. "Crime should be no more acceptable within the walls of our correctional facilities than it is in the streets of our communities," Green said.

CONTEXT	 The British and Irish Lions are to play 10 matches on their tour of South Africa next year, including three Tests against the world champion Springboks, organisers said on Thursday.The Tests against the Boks will take place on June 20 in Durban, June 27 in Pretoria and July 4 in Johannesburg. No Test has been scheduled for Cape Town, the headquarters of SA Rugby. "We are looking forward to touring such a wonderful country and playing the World Champions on their own turf," Lions chairman Andy Irvine told reporters at the announcement of the schedule in Cape Town. "The tour itself promises to be full of challenges in a country where rugby is a real passion but I am certain that the 2009 Lions will acquit themselves well." Jonathan Stones, managing director of SA Rugby, predicted the tour would be a box-office smash on a par with South Africa's hosting of the 1995 rugby World Cup. "The Lions tour will be a massive sporting event, on par with the rugby World Cup, and is expected to be a huge success. We are putting in place an exciting programme and look forward to His view was backed up Paul Vaughan, managing director of England Rugby Travel (ERT) and business operations director at the Rugby Football Union (RFU), who is expecting record numbers of travelling fans for a Lions tour. More than 10,000 supporters have already registered their interest in going on tour with ERT and Vaughan said, in a statement: "The British and Irish Lions tours are very special "They are truly unique sporting experiences which is why so many supporters want to be part of them. "The tour of South Africa combines some fascinating rugby encounters in the early stages with three immense Test matches against the Rugby World Cup winners. Mix this up with the chance The Lions will play matches in seven cities over a period of six weeks, commencing with a game against a Highveld XV in Rustenburg on May 30. The tour schedule includes six weekend fixtures and four midweek matches. Apart from the three Test matches, there is also a fixture against the Emerging Springboks on June 23. The Lions have toured South Africa on 12 previous occasions, with the first tour to this country taking place in 1891.

Afterward, there were the discrepancies in Wisconsin's And fittingly, Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema couldn't find a wind- resistant explanation to his most scrutinized decision of Tuesday's 21-17 loss to Tennessee. Trailing by four, the second-year coach opted to go for it on fourth and 2 from the Vols 10 with just more than six minutes left instead of allowing Lou Groza Award semifinalist Taylor Mehlhaff to try a 27-yarder that would've put Wisconsin within But the play failed when Tennessee perfectly covered a flood route. Quarterback Tyler Donovan rolled right and, unable to find an open receiver, scrambled left before overthrowing tight end "They did a good job outflanking it and shutting down the preliminary stuff," said Donovan, sacked three times and jarred several others . "I tried to make something happen. Give Tennessee credit for doing a good job of shutting it down." Wisconsin had first down at the UT 36, which projects to a 53-yard field goal, when Wardlow made the game-sealing pick. The luxury of hindsight likely will leave Bielema, bereft of timeouts on Wisconsin's final drive, with few defenders.

Apart from that, Natalegawa disclosed that Indonesia has talked with Malaysia, the chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, asking Malaysia to jointly explore the possibility of holding an emergency meeting of the UNSC to avert war in Iraq. Bilaterally, Indonesia would request the UNSC member countries' support for the emergency session to stop the war in Iraq, said Natalegawa. The spokesman noted that each of the UN member countries had rights to propose a meeting of the UNSC, but the final decision would be decided by all members of the council. "Hopefully the idea will be supported by the UNSC," he said. He said that the most important thing now was that the US aggression in Iraq must be stopped, because of violation of the international law. He added that the UNSC should take an action and respond over the crisis in Iraq. "It is funny if the UN focuses on many problems, except the Iraq crisis," he said. Indonesian President Megawati Soekarnoputri on Thursday stated that the Indonesian government would continue diplomatic efforts to stop the US invasion in Iraq.

Ao Man-long, a former transport and public works secretary, is charged with 76 counts of taking bribes, laundering money and abusing his power to help property developers win lucrative construction tenders in the gambling resort. Ao has denied any He is the highest government official to be charged with graft, and his trial comes as the former Portuguese territory is trying shrug off a reputation for organized crime and reinvent itself as holiday destination in the image of Las Vegas. In recent years, Macau -- the only place in China where casino gambling is legal -- has drawn several high profile Las Vegas operators who have invested billions of dollars (euros) in building upscale casino resorts to attract China's newly rich. Ao is accused of handing some of those construction contracts to companies in return for kickbacks. The disgraced minister, arrested in December 2006, denied any wrongdoing during the monthlong trial which ended at the end of last year. If convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison. The court was to deliver its verdict Wednesday afternoon. In a four-month investigation, anti-graft officials said they discovered assets worth about 800 million patacas (US$99.52 million; euro67.39 million), more than 57 times what Ao and his family could have earned over a seven-year period. Officials said they traced the money to bank accounts in Hong Kong and London, including some in the name of Ao's relatives. Due to his seniority, Ao was tried by a three-judge panel at Macau's highest court -- the Court of Final Appeal. This raised some question about whether he could appeal if found guilty. Ao's family, including his father and wife, and four business associates are also facing a range of money laundering charges in a separate ongoing trial. Macau, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of Hong Kong, returned to Chinese rule in 1999.

Mercader said the ``smoking gun,'' though, arrived through an analysis of starch embedded in some stones. Chimpanzees currently living in the Tai region are known to crack open five types of nut, four of which are not used by local humans. A microscope- aided analysis suggested that at least three-fourths of the starch granules on the stones came from nuts and that a significant fraction were from those nut varieties used only by suggests that nut-cracking behavior in the forest has been passed The prehistoric chimpanzee site, the study authors conclude, down from chimp to chimp over the course of more than 200 generations. is now Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park using grass as a In 1960, primatologist Jane Goodall saw a wild chimpanzee in what tool to fish termites from a mound -- one of the first among many observations challenging the assumption that tool use was the sole province of humans. Varied tool uses, she asserted, could be passed down as a kind of primitive chimpanzee culture. Since then, her argument has been buttressed by observed tool use in nearly all of the great apes and in other animals such as dolphins and crows. ``I think what's changed now is not only our perception of what makes humans human, but we've become keenly aware of how we intentionally shaped, the latter of which is now considered a human hallmark. ``While this continues to knock humans off the pedestal of tool user,'' Fuentes said, ``this reinforces the notion that the real difference between humans and other tool-using primates is the Ross cautioned that chimpanzees can readily mimic nut-cracking by humans, as some of the zoo's chimps have ably demonstrated. Nevertheless, he said Mercader's study provides ``pretty compelling evidence that these cultural transmissions go back several thousands of years.'' The simplest explanation, Mercader said, is that the behavioral roots of nut cracking originated with the ancestor of both humans and chimpanzees, though testing such a prediction would require archaeological evidence from far earlier sites.

CONTEXT	The move was widely praised across the political spectrum but it  still needs to be applied by the Department of Health and Human Services. China's reported decision to lift a ban on HIV-positive visitors next year, close on the heels of a huge US step towards removing its own 21-year ban, raised spirits at an international AIDS meeting in Mexico Wednesday. The reported imminent lifting of the Chinese ban blocking HIV/AIDS carriers from entering the country came amid increasing international pressure on some 67 countries which still deny Many of the scientists, policymakers and field workers at the massive, six-day International AIDS Conference in Mexico slammed the restrictions as discriminatory, violations of human rights couldn't speak about it and couldn't come to international "This issue got quite sidelined because those most impacted conferences," said Robert Bank, CEO of Gay Men's Health Crisis advocacy group, adding that International AIDS Conferences had played a part in raising awareness of the need to lift the ban. At the end of last month, US President George W. Bush signed a 48 -billion-dollar package of legislation to fight AIDS in developing countries, including the lifting of the US ban. Craig McClure, executive director of the International AIDS Society, said he believed international momentum was beginning to pick up on the issue. On the eve of the Beijing Olympics, China appeared to be following the trend too. "HIV/AIDS restrictions will be lifted in 2009," the China Daily said Wednesday, citing Hao Yang, deputy director of the health ministry's disease control and prevention bureau, in Mexico. China introduced the ban in the late 1980s after it reported its first AIDS case in 1985, hoping to limit the spread of the virus by keeping it outside the country, according to the report. The US total ban on entry -- which many said placed the US in a group of eight countries, including undemocratic Libya and Saudi Arabia -- also took force amid fear and hysteria surrounding HIV/AIDS in the late 1980s. their HIV status, a temporary visa and a permanent blot on their National restrictions range from requiring visitors to declare passport, complusory tests, or expulsion of illegal immigrants and total bans. "The cliche excuse from all governments is that they want to protect their citizens," said Suskma Ratri, program officer for migrants with HIV at the CARAM Asia network of NGOs researching AIDS and mobility. "But in a lot of cases, people were negative when they went to the destination, but contracted it there." "Many people believe that should they test positive, they'll be deported," said Amanda Lugg of the African Services Committee helping immigrants in New York City. HIV-positive Singaporean Gurmit Singh was one of the few who had been affected by visa restrictions and was present in Mexico. He appealed, and was finally offered a renewable, two-year conditional visa that included compulsory health screenings every three months. He declined because he feared he would not have and said they fail to protect public health. 2005, but his visa application revealed his HIV-positive status Singh, 36, won a scholarship to study for a PHD in Australia in and his request was rejected for failing to meet the "health requirements" for the long-term visa. been allowed to finish his PHD. Toronto lifted Canada's ban for its conference in 2006 and the bi-annual meeting has not been held in the United States for the past two decades due to the US ban. there have been rumblings in other countries, including Russia "Already in the past two weeks since the (US) news came out, and the United Arab Emirates," he told AFP. Migrant workers to Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates have mandatory annual HIV testing and can be deported if they are found to be HIV positive, forcing them to lose their jobs and face stigma at home too.

The liberal opposition in parliament said the Korean collaboration with the Japanese occupiers and postwar government's attempt to censor the textbooks was reminiscent of those dictatorships, which once exercised control so complete that it included what books South Koreans could read and the proper length of women's skirts.

Conservatives say the "left leaning" textbooks poison the minds of teenagers by reveling in dark corners of history. The books, they say, inspire a masochistic view of Korean history by demeaning the role of the Allied forces in Korea's liberation from Japan, casting the United States as an imperial power, and by dwelling on the faults of South Korean dictators while slighting their achievements, including their contributions to the country's economic growth.

Chun deployed forces in 1980 that killed hundreds of pro-democracy protesters in Gwangju, a southern city. When the United States, which technically had command of the combined American-South Korean forces, did not prevent Chun's junta from unleashing troops against its own people, students turned against Washington. If the division of the peninsula engendered a mistrust of big powers, Gwangju helped shape views of the United States, historians say.

CONTEXT	$6,697 for every man, woman and child, according to the figures accounting for 16 percent of all economic activity and averaging released by the Department of Health and Human Services and published in the journal Health Affairs.  Government figures released Tuesday show that Americans are getting a respite from the torrid pace of increases in health- care spending, but experts cautioned that it was too soon for a national sigh of relief. The data show that in 2005, spending on health care grew 6.9 percent. That was the smallest rate of increase since 1999 and marked the third consecutive year in which the pace had moderated. Because of the time required to collect and analyze Although the rate of increase declined, health-care spending in 2005 still grew faster than wages, inflation and the economy as a whole. And with employers continuing to shift more of the cost of numbers mean the crisis is over,'' said Henry Simmons, president ``It would be a disaster if people thought these (spending) of the National Coalition on Health Care, which advocates for covering the uninsured. ``Even if costs are only going up at 6.9 percent, that is still two or three times the rate of growth in Minarik is a senior vice president of the Committee for Economic Development, a group of CEOs that tries to influence public policy on major issues. Nationwide, health spending reached nearly $2 trillion, Government experts also found another glimmer of hope in an arcane but important statistic that measures the amount of spending on the sickest people. Traditionally 5 percent of patients -- the most frail -- have accounted for more than half of all spending in any given year. But in 2003, the share of spending on these very ill patients dipped to 49 percent, suggesting that doctors are reducing costly hospitalizations through better management of chronic diseases The release of the numbers, an annual snapshot of the health-care system, coincides with Gov.

CONTEXT	for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the nonprofit entity overseen by the Transplant policy also made news last winter. The United Network Department of Health and Human Services that maintains the national waiting list and allocates cadaver organs, held a public meeting to propose that younger adults get priority for kidneys. livers, hearts and lungs: The chasm between supply and demand It is a sad time for the 96,000 patients waiting for kidneys, grows wider each year. In any 24-hour span, 18 people in need of an organ will die because they did not get one soon enough.  In desperation, many of these individuals advertise in print or online for good Samaritan kidney and liver donors. Some even go overseas to participate in a thriving -- and shady -- black To be fair, medical professionals, policymakers and transplant bureaucrats have not been idle. They are working to expand the number of organs available from deceased donors and to improve methods of distributing this scarce resource most efficiently. These efforts will help but won't come close to meeting demand; last year there were about 10,600 cadaver kidneys and 6,400 from legislatures have enacted or passed a model law that clarifies This month, The Washington Post reported that eight state matters of donor consent (the measure is pending in 17 more states plus the District of Columbia). One thorny circumstance concerns the question of unconscious patients who, in life, that they do not wish to be put on life support if they stood signed an organ donor card but also specified in a living will little chance of breathing on their own. Fulfillment of their desire to donate might require them being kept on a ventilator for several hours to maintain organ viability until a transplant can take place. Some bioethicists say a person's instructions for end-of-life care should always take precedence over his or her desire to bequeath organs. I doubt that a few extra hours on a machine to salvage organs would Currently all adults, regardless of age, receive well-matched kidneys on a first-come, first-served basis. But UNOS is understandably troubled when a young kidney, able to prolong by decades the life of, say, a 40-year-old, instead goes to a 70-year-old who dies a few years later, taking the organ with him (the chance that such an organ could be retransplanted proposal was mixed. ``Who's to say an older person's five years is slim). At the UNOS meeting, which I attended, reaction to the of life are any less important than a younger person's nine years?'' one of the many skeptical attendees asked. ``That's playing God.'' No, it's playing human -- the all-too-human business of deliberating strenuously and in good faith about what is right. Should the utilitarian imperative of enhancing survival across Lamentably, too many transplant professionals are resigned to rationing. The alternative is to create a larger supply of organs -- and the most likely way to achieve it is through a safe, regulated system in which donors can receive compensation for their organs. The idea of rewarding living donors for a kidney, or their estates if they give an organ after death, has long been taboo. Yet as thousands die every year the idea is being taken A growing number of physicians, legal scholars and ethicists are urging pilot studies of a regulated system with strong donor protections. This would require Congress to amend the 1984 receive ``valuable consideration.'' Such consideration could take National Organ Transplant Act so people who give organs could many forms, perhaps something as simple as offering them lifelong Medicare coverage. This could also serve as a compelling incentive to other prospective donors. Or Congress could grant Kidneys are in highest demand; currently, 71,000 people need a renal transplant. They will spend, on average, five years on dialysis while waiting for an organ from a deceased donor.

We need to move beyond the idea that organs must be relinquished as gifts. The altruistic motive is deeply noble and loving. But relying upon it as the sole legitimate reason for giving an organ is causing too many unnecessary deaths.

"The issue is, `What does it cost?'" Bill Gates ... and solve this problem,'" said Dale Jamieson, "The temptation is to say, `Let's get John Wayne on horseback or director of environmental studies at New York University. Sucking It Up on Behalf of Global Warming Here's a simple solution to global warming: vacuum carbon dioxide out of the air.

He estimates that sucking up the current stream of emissions would require about 67 million boxcar-sized filters at a cost of trillions of dollars a year. The orchards of filters would have to be powered by complexes of new nuclear plants, dams, solar farms or other clean-energy sources to avoid adding more pollution to the atmosphere. Despite the scope of the proposal, the allure of high technology is irresistible for modern humans. Salvation has arrived again and again over the last century: the automobile, the jet, the The potential of technology has pushed scattered groups of scientists to work on massive schemes to re-engineer the planet. volcanoes to blast sulfur particles into the atmosphere or by One idea is to block sunlight, either by constructing artificial launching millions of tiny satellites into space and arranging them into a giant mirror. But while the science of dialing back the planet's thermostat is straightforward, the execution is fabulously expensive, complex and grandiose on a scale that boggles the mind. But some scientists say that the potential of such ideas cannot be ignored given the world's political paralysis on controlling emissions and its myopic addiction to cheap and dirty coal. The attraction of a technological silver bullet lies in the failure of the world to solve global warming through the obvious solution: reducing emissions. Worldwide annual emissions of carbon dioxide -- the main culprit in global warming -- have climbed 28 percent over the last decade, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The rise has Among the options, carbon filtering is the most direct and best understood. If industrialization is a process of transferring carbon stored in the earth to the atmosphere, filtering seeks to put it back. compound, usually a hydroxide, in contact with the air, setting The process for removing atmospheric carbon involves putting one off a reaction that grabs CO2 and incorporates its carbon atoms into a carbonate compound. Then, in a reaction that requires a large input of heat, the carbonate compound is broken apart, reconstituting and trapping the carbon dioxide. The beauty of carbon capture is that it scrubs the planet without intruding on it, unlike artificial volcanoes and sun reflectors, which could cause enormous planetary damage in the form of acid For all its appeal, the process is hideously inefficient. Carbon dioxide makes up less than 0.04 percent of the atmosphere, and removing climate-changing quantities of it requires filtering massive amounts of air. Lackner calculated that sucking up all 28 billion tons of CO2 released worldwide each year would require spreading out his machines over a land area the size of Arizona. Even filtering the greenhouse gas from smokestacks, where it is hundreds of times more concentrated and thus much less expensive to capture, is still deemed too expensive for commercial use. foot the bill because it created the problem over the last two agreement to reduce emissions.

The commander of Canada's 2,500 troops in Afghanistan narrowly escaped a suicide bombing on his convoy of armored vehicles Thursday, Canadian media said. But officials would not say if Brigadier General Tim Grant was riding in the convoy. The general, who is only days away from ending his nine-month tour in Afghanistan, was reportedly traveling in one of three vehicles in the convoy from the town of Shur Andan to Kandahar City, where the Canadians are based. Officials said the attack came on the main road linking Kandahar air base to the city. Earlier this month, one of deadliest explosions on NATO forces in Afghanistan destroyed an RG-31 vehicle, killing all six Canadians and an Afghan interpreter inside.

CONTEXT	 CMA AGAIN PICKS CHESNEY AS ENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR Brad Paisley, the country singer, songwriter and lead guitarist, was ubiquitous at the 42nd annual Country Music Association Awards on Wednesday night. At the live broadcast from Nashville on ABC, he started the show in a duet with Keith Urban on "Start a Band," made mildly risque jokes as one of the show's hosts (along with the singer Carrie Underwood), performed his hit "Waitin' on a Woman" (which was named Video of the Year), picked some solo guitar in a brief tribute to Jerry Reed and was named Male Vocalist of the Year. But the show's top award, Entertainer of the Year, went to Kenny Chesney, the fourth time he had won the award. The show touched country's various bases: from traditionalist honky-tonk and heartbreak to the music's modern incarnations as both strobe-lighted spectacle and as a refuge, in the music-video era, for rootsy, storytelling songwriters. The Song of the Year was "Stay," a tale of infidelity written and sung by Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland. That group, which started as a trio but is now the duo of Nettles and Kristian Bush, was also named Vocal Duo of the Year. The Vocal Group of the Year was Rascal Flatts. George Strait, 56, reinforced his status as a country patriarch with awards for both a single and his latest album. The Single of the Year was "I Saw God Today," about the birth of a baby girl; the Album of the Year was "Troubadour." Like most of the winners, With fewer than a dozen awards to hand out over three hours, the show doubles as a prime-time broadcast showcase for country music, and performers had new material to promote.

Underwood was named Female Vocalist of the Year, her third award in that category. Underwood got her big break as a 2005 winner on "American Idol," and she thanked In virtually the only allusion to the presidential election, Paisley asked Underwood how many outfits she wore during the show -- seven counting the red carpet, she replied. He then asked, "Are you at 150 grand yet?" a reference to the campaign wardrobe of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska. with its arena-friendly chorus of "doo-doo-doo." Kellie Pickler classic country. Urban performed his new single, "Sweet Thing," wore a black leather minidress and stiletto-heeled boots to perform "Best Days of Your Life," a post-breakup rocker she wrote with Swift. Sugarland's "Love" -- performed, oddly enough, on a suggesting rain overhead -- had unmistakable echoes of U2. stage full of illuminated umbrellas, with flashing lights Paisley joked that the stage set came from the Beijing Olympics. But for every power chord, there was also a twang, as in Brooks &amp; Dunn's "Cowgirls Don't Cry" with Reba McEntire harmonizing, or a ballad, like Trace Adkins' "You're Gonna Miss midway through his old-fashioned "Just Got Started Lovin' You" This" and Miranda Lambert's "More Like Her." James Otto announced that it was the most-played song of the year on country radio stations. The Eagles, the country-rock band whose sound took over the country mainstream, wore dark suits and ties and strummed and harmonized smoothly through their "Busy Being Fabulous." The show made a point of welcoming black musicians. Underwood called for "respect" as she introduced Darius Rucker, the lead singer from Hootie and the Blowfish.

The conference is scheduled for Dec. 7-11.  Velayati arrives in Syria at start of 10-nation tour Eds: UPDATES with EU envoy meeting with Syrian foreign ministery in Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati arrived in Syria on Sunday at the start of a 10-nation tour that also will take him to Sudan and Uganda. Asked about the U.S. veto of a U.N. Security Council resolution criticizing Israel's decision to build more Jewish housing in Arab east Jerusalem, Velayati said it was expected. East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, is the site of Islam's third holiest shrine, the Al-Aqsa Mosque. European support for Syria's stand that the negotiations should resume visited France, the Netherlands, Italy and Austria to try to win where they left off a year ago. They are to continue their European mission with a visit to Germany starting March 19. Syria demands the return of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, in exchange for peace. Netanyahu, a hard- liner, says the heights are critical for Israeli security. Velayati will visit Sudan and Uganda to discuss an Iranian initiative aimed at restoring relations between the two countries, IRNA said. Sudan and Uganda have been trading accusations since 1989 that each other's government was arming and harboring rebels. They broke relations in 1995. Velayati also plans to stop in the Czech Republic, the agency said. In Damascus, Velayati met with Syrian President Hafez Assad and a presidential spokesman told reporters after the two-hour meeting that Syria had accepted Iran's invitation to attend the Islamic conference in Tehran. Velayati was met at the airport by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al- Sharaa. ``The United States is supporting all Israel's inhuman and illegitimate activities.'' He said it was ``a lesson to all Islamic nations'' that they should unite and step up their efforts to liberate Jerusalem. Al-Sharaa noted that the United States has frequently taken Israel's side in U.N. debates. In this case, he said, the U.S. stance ``would give Israel the freedom to go ahead with settlement construction while the U.S. is watching.'' Also in the Syrian capital on Sunday was Miguel Moratinos, the European Union's special envoy to the Middle East. He met with al- Sharaa and discussed the impasse in Israeli-Syria peace negotiations. Al-Sharaa and Syrian Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam recently Syria is Iran's closest Arab ally since it backed the Persian nation in its 1980-88 war with Arab Iraq. damas-fsa-eap-sf

The Azia fits the bill. Battle-hardened Canadian soldiers are being indulged in the five- star luxury of the holiday island of Cyprus to re-acclimatise them to civilian life after enduring Afghanistan's war zones. Most of Canada's 2,500 troops in Afghanistan will undergo "decompression" -- military terminology for a programme designed to ease the physical and mental rigours of life in the combat After completing their six-month tour on the Afghan battlefront, some 2,100 soldiers are under orders to enjoy five days of sun and sea in this eastern Mediterranean holiday playground before they rotate back home. But it is not just gratuitous pampering. The programme is also about mending the battle-scarred minds of those who may be grappling with the pain of loss. "Some soldiers have experienced the loss of friends and colleagues, that's why we have mental health staff on hand to deal with such cases," said Major Michel Ouellet, the 47-year-old Montreal native in charge of a 40-person team overseeing the month-long decompression tour. "A fair amount of soldiers will have been affected by such loss. This was expected and that's why we planned for it," he said. Since the US-led occupation of Afghanistan was launched in October 2001, 66 Canadian soldiers have been killed there -- 22 of them so far this year. The most recent fatalities were on July 4, when six Canadian soldiers were killed by a bomb southwest of Kandahar in Canada's highest single-day toll in the country since 2002. months ago some 1,700 Canadians were billeted in five hotels in The Cyprus decompression tour is the second within a year.

"The people here are very welcoming everywhere you go. It's a million-dollar view. You don't get this often. Everything is impressive," Ouellet said. "The welfare of the troops comes first, especially to provide the best for them to enjoy and decompress appropriately. We had requested from bidders specific items that they had to have.

CONTEXT	 Air Macau to lease aircraft for start-up fleet Macau's fledgling airline, Air Macau, will lease several aircraft for its start up fleet with an option to buy, the Portuguese news agency LUSA reported Friday. A decision on the deal was scheduled to be made by the company's board of directors before the end of this month, LUSA quoted an Air Macau source as saying. The source declined to say how many and what type of aircraft will be leased, but stressed that the fleet would be operational in time for the opening of the Macau International Airport, scheduled for December In addition to the aircraft leasing arrangement, the new airline plans to invest some 150 million patacas (18.75 million dollars) in aviation equipment and EDP software by the end of the year, the report said. The airline plans to be operating scheduled flights to China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and Japan by 1997 and to operate intercontinental flights after that date. By 2000, Air Macau will have a projected staff of 200, including pilots. Some of the new airline's senior aviation staff will be recruited from Portugal's national airline, TAP-Air Portugal. The airline, which was founded in September, is a locally incorporated Sino-Portuguese joint stock company. The single runway Macau International Airport off Taipa Island is budgeted to cost a total of 7.6 billion patacas (950 million dollars).

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) stipulates that any coastal state can claim an exclusive economic zone beyond the established 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers), Interest in the economic exploitation of the Arctic has increased significantly in recent years as melting ice floes have eased access to the region's rich oil and gas reserves.

CONTEXT	tests given to high school students that are designed to be the For those of you new to this obsession, AP and IB are courses and equivalent of introductory college courses in about two dozen subjects. They impress selective-college admissions offices. If the students do well on the tests, they can earn college credits of AP in Texas that appeared to break new ground. Since these advance copy for reporters, I saw a reference to two new studies were reports by independent researchers, I sought them out and asked to see their work.  Both studies attempted to put this competition on a level playing field by comparing the college success of AP students to those non-AP students (or AP students who did not take the AP exam) who Higher Education Coordinating Board researcher Donn Godin, of Texas researchers Linda Hargrove and Barbara Dodd and Texas compared students with about the same SAT or ACT scores, or similar family economic circumstances. But Saul Geiser, the University of California scholar who produced his own massive AP and college success study in 2004, said these comparisons are still a problem. ``The main technical issue that bedevils not only the Texas studies but all research of this kind concerns the question of selection bias: To what extent is AP students' success in college a reflection of the AP program itself (a 'program effect') as students who could be expected to perform well in college even program historically has targeted 'better,' academically stronger without AP. measures, primarily SAT scores, in order to control for student selection bias by 'matching' AP and non-AP students on other background characteristics. But neither study controls for a sufficiently robust set of student characteristics to rule out the hypothesis that selection effects account for most of the relationship between AP and college outcomes.'' introductory courses are so special that no AP grade is high grade, a 5, on the AP exam to get credit. Some insist that their enough. But the amount of research they have devoted to proving their point is laughingly small. Harvard made a rule that only 5s will count -- and only if a student is going for sophomore on the advanced course than students who have taken the college's small number of courses that show the AP or IB students do better intro course. But most colleges have no data. When you ask them on what they rest their restrictive rules, they shrug and say the faculty wanted it that way. it concludes that students who received AP credit in 10 subjects The Texas study has to be read very carefully, because although at UT did better in the advanced course than students who first took the intro course, picking the right advanced course for the researchers to gather data from and study was difficult, and in students who took advanced college courses, so their work cannot college introductory courses. They sadly did not look at AP be directly compared to the UT study, but theirs and the Texas study are going to be the principal pieces of evidence in debates on this issue. ``I am not overly surprised that dual-enrollment courses don't have the same impact as AP. I'll put good money on the table that dual-enrollment courses are capturing a somewhat different population. What would be interesting would be to compare the But there is more interesting data in the Texas AP studies that touches on this, since there were plenty of Spanish-speaking AP students in their large sample. Many students -- almost 2,000 in one cohort -- took the AP exam but not the AP course, extremely rare in AP courses other than Spanish. else. In the larger of the two studies, ``the correlation between Educational Accountability in Austin, Texas, noticed something AP exam grades and college outcomes seems to go away for students with lower prior SAT scores. This may well be due to the large number of native Spanish speakers in Texas who earn credit on the AP Spanish exam, but who may not be well prepared in or take AP exams in other subjects, and who thus would populate the statewide group of high AP exam scorers with low SAT scores.'' What does it all mean? It will take some time to figure that out. There is too much data here to absorb all at once, and we are likely to see an acceleration of research on AP and IB, given activist who has studied AP results among minority students, senior study director I quoted in my news article. An educational Hawkins believes it is not so much what is learned in AP, but the act of struggling with a difficult course that adds the most value. ``So taking AP courses and exams is highly associated with college outcomes down the road,'' he said, summing up this research. ``But I think this happens not just because the kids who take these courses learn stuff and master knowledge (college level work), but because these kids also in the process become better learners, students, scholars. They end up mastering the importance of working hard, clearly something that will serve

CONTEXT	 The largest sperm bank in New York state was ordered Tuesday to close its doors by next Tuesday, after a state Supreme Court justice found that the state Department of Health was justified in refusing to license the company. The bank's owner, Daxor Corp., and its president, Dr. Joseph Feldschuh, had gone to court to try to force the Health Department to conduct a hearing on its application to operate blood banks, tissue But the Health Department argued successfully before Justice Harold Tompkins that Daxor and its subsidiaries _ including Idant Laboratories, one of only two sperm banks in the country when it opened in 1971 _ had endangered the public health by repeatedly violating Health Department laws and regulations and was therefore not entitled to a licensing hearing. In a 1993 inspection, investigators for the Health Department documented 517 violations at Idant, including the company's failure to screen sperm donors properly for sexually transmitted diseases. The inspection showed that the company had, in fact, made available semen from men who had tested positive for hepatitis, chlamydia and gonorrhea, that it had not taken complete medical and sexual histories ``The Health Department has refused to license Daxor and its subsidiaries because the company has demonstrated a pattern of noncompliance with department regulations designed to protect the Feldschuh said his lawyers were filing an appeal and asking that Tompkins' decision, which was issued Monday, be put on hold until the appeal can be heard. Feldschuh said Health Department officials were conspiring to shut down his business because they disapprove of private blood banking. ``The blood bank is the basic target,'' Feldschuh said in a telephone interview last night in which he denied all the Health Department As a result of Tompkins' decision, the Health Department sent a letter Tuesday to Feldschuh informing him of the proper procedures for closing down his companies' operations, including the need to notify In addition to providing semen for anonymous artificial inseminations, the company also stores blood and semen for people who, for various personal and health reasons, may wish to use them in the future. Ms. Mathis said there are 44 state-approved gamete banks in New York state that are licensed to perform all or parts of the procedures involved in artificial insemination. She said that while there was no precise way to compare the size of the various companies, the Health Department believes that Idant, which is not licensed or approved, has been running the largest sperm bank in the state based on its size and the number of specimens it handles. banks, clinical laboratories and semen banks in New York City. public's health,'' said Diane Mathis, a department spokeswoman. charges against him and his companies.

Richard Nesbitt, the In 1997, it became one of the first major national exchanges to chief executive of the TSE's parent, the TSX Group, said the move came about largely because the exchange could not afford to maintain both floor and electronic trading. Like many exchanges until recently, the TSE had been owned by a partnership of the country's brokerages. Those partners have been accused of neglecting the operation. In 1999 and 2000, in Until now, the TSE's competition remained indirect for the most part. Canadian companies have a long tradition of offering secondary listings elsewhere, mostly in the United States. The Domestic competition for the TSE came mostly in niche products like junior stock listings. One leader in that field, the Canadian Trading and Quotation System, which calls itself CNQ, is behind Pure Trading. Although the TSE was seen as progressive for its electronic platform, Ian Bandeen, the chief executive of Pure Trading and CNQ, said the exchange had gradually created an opening for being performed on U.S. markets because of what people thought said. "But most Canadians hadn't realized how much trading was was suboptimal performance by the TSE."

CONTEXT	five fruitless finals appearances when it beat Port Adelaide Minor premiers Geelong broke a 44-year title drought and a run of 24.19 (163), 6.8 (44) in the Australian Rules Football League Grand Final on Saturday.  The Geelong Cats topped regular season standings by 12 points with a 19-win, one-loss record to secure the minor premiership, and confirmed their rating as the best team in the AFL with Saturday's historic win over the 2004 champions. "We were the best side all year and we thoroughly deserve this," Geelong midfielder Joel Corey said. Geelong became the first team from the state of Victoria since Essendon in 2000 to win the AFL title when they eased to victory in front of a crowd of 98,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Coach Mark Thompson became the seventh man in AFL history to have both captained and coached a team to premiership victory. He had previous captained Essendon to the championship in 1993. Geelong's 119-point win was the largest in grand final history, dwarfing Hawthorn's 96-point win over Melbourne in 1998. The Cats dominated the match, outscoring Port Adelaide 5.7 to 2.2 in the first quarter, before kicking five goals in the first 12 minutes of the second quarter to build a 52-point lead. Geelong were on top in every aspect of the contest, with their defense -- which has been the best in the competition all season -- keeping Port Adelaide to their lowest score of the year. "We just want to thank the fans for their patience," Thompson said. "It's been a long time coming but it's worth the wait." Geelong's Steve Johnson was named Man of the Match. Johnson began the season suspended for off-field behaviour and ended up an All- Australian and premiership player.

Gates pledged that the United States would continue training and modernizing Iraqi security forces to enable Iraq to defend itself from attack from abroad. But he made clear that in the future, U.S. commanders have long stressed that the military cannot bring about peace in Iraq without political progress, and Gates on Friday called the Baghdad security plan ``a strategy for buying time for progress toward justice and reconciliation.'' Asked how Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had responded, Gates said Maliki had reminded him that the parliament is independent, suggesting he could make no assurances on the legislation. Gates, after a day of meetings with U.S. commanders and Iraqi leaders, offered a less upbeat assessment of the Baghdad security plan than he did March 18, when he said, ``So far, so good.''

CONTEXT	 East China, including the commercial hub of Shanghai, is preparing for what may be the most destructive typhoon in a decade, which is likely to make landfall in Zhejiang Province At 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, Wipha's center was about 297 kilometers southeast of Wenling, a coastal city in southwestern Zhejiang, and was accelerating northwestward at 25 km to 30 km per hour, according to the Zhejiang Provincial Meteorological Station. Wipha was likely to make landfall between Rui'an city, southwestern Zhejiang, and Xiangshan, in the eastern part of the province, before Wednesday morning, the station said. The "super typhoon" is packing gale-force winds of 198 kilometers per hour at its center, and is likely to maintain its momentum after making landfall, it said. It has churned up winds of up to 90 km per hour in the coast of Zhejiang. The province has received an average 31.8 mm of rain from 5:00 p.m. Monday to 2:00 p.m. Tuesday, with the maximum rainfall measuring 162 mm in some cities, the station said. The downpours have filled some rivers and reservoirs in southeastern areas of the province to their warning marks. By 3:00 p.m., a total of one million people in Shanghai, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces had been evacuated, and the relocations are still continuing. Shanghai issued a super typhoon warning on Tuesday afternoon, after Wipha was upgraded since the previous typhoon warning. Zhang Jiayi, deputy chief of the Shanghai flood control headquarters, said the city, with a population of 19 million, is facing its most severe test in decades. The Central Meteorological Administration (CMA) has commenced a "Level One" emergency plan, the highest level of alert. All meteorological units are required to have personnel on duty 24 hours a day and the CMA will produce hourly reports on the location of the typhoon. The Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief has issued a "Level Two" flood control emergency response plan and has sent four teams to the four coastal provinces expected to be hit by Shanghai and the neighboring Suzhou city have issued notices to close all kindergartens and middle schools on Wednesday. It has canceled a parade of festooned vehicles, set for Tuesday night on a square in the Pudong New District, to mark the opening of the annual Shanghai Tourism Festival. Two zoos in the city are taking precautions against the typhoon, caging the animals, cutting off electricity to prevent fire outbreaks and deploying more staff overnight. "Fallen trees may hurt the animals and some may take the chance to climb up the trees and escape, so we need to ground them for the moment," said Xiong Chenpei, director of the Shanghai zoo. The Pinghu oil rig, situated some 400 km southwest of Shanghai on the East China Sea, is expected to bear the brunt of the typhoon and its 365 staffs have been evacuated in boats and helicopters. Meanwhile, the football federation has decided to push ahead with a women's World Cup match between the United States and Nigeria at 8:00 p.m. Tuesday in Shanghai. The local organizing committee has formed a flood control team, inspecting seats and clearing or strengthening billboards around the stadium. The government of Taizhou, southeastern Zhejiang, has closed all schools and factories, and advised the public to stay indoors and avoid going out until the weather clears. Chen Hongyi, deputy chief of the Taizhou meteorological bureau, said the intensity of the typhoon had been close to that of Saomai, the eighth typhoon last year which claimed more than 400 "If Wipha made landfall in Taizhou, it would be the strongest typhoon in history to land in the city," he said. The Health Department of Zhejiang has dispatched four teams of doctors to Wenzhou and Taizhou to help local people, while another eight teams are standing by. Fujian province on China's southeastern coast has sent out 1.41 million text messages to warn the public of the upcoming typhoon, the local flood control headquarters said. The headquarters have warned the public to stay away flood-prone areas, avoid going out in high winds and to stock up on food and water. Fujian has forecast driving rain and gales of 90 kilometers per hour in the coastal areas on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Taking their cue from airline networks SkyTeam, Star Alliance and One World, the companies want to make connections easier by improving scheduling and hooking up reservation systems. From January 2009, passengers will need only one ticket for a cross-border trip with multiple connections, making it possible for example to go from Frankfurt to London passing through Paris on a single ticket. Railteam aims to transport 25 million passengers per year as of 2010 from 15 million currently with high-speed rail lines expected to be extended by a third by 2020 to 15,000 kilometres

The conventional explanation for why female leaders are widely perceived as mannish, conniving and ruthless -- not just by men but by other women, too -- is that politics is tough, and the psychological experiments have shown that a subtler dynamic is at In recent years, however, a host of cleverly designed play -- a motif now on display in the United States as Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., tries to become the United States' first female president. The driving factor in the way women leaders are perceived, experiments show, is not that they are any more ruthless than men who get to the top, but that people have strong and often unconscious conceptions about men, women and the nature of leadership. "The roots are in stereotypes about women, men and leaders," said Alice Eagly, a social psychologist at Northwestern University and co-author of "Through the Labyrinth," a new book about the psychological dynamics of women and leadership. "Culturally, women are the nicer sex and men are more aggressive go-getters. Leaders are generically in our culture more like men than women in the way people think about leaders." Experiments show that women vying for leadership roles are automatically assigned two labels. The first is to be seen as nice and warm, but incompetent; the second is to be seen as competent but unpleasant. Women stuck with Label A cannot be leaders, because the stereotype of leadership is incompatible with incompetence. Women who do become leaders get stuck with Label B, because if leadership is unconsciously associated with manliness, cognitive consistency requires that female leaders be stripped of the caring qualities normally associated with women. "When people say Hillary has no heart or no sense of humor, they are saying she is not warm," said Susan Fiske, a social psychologist at Princeton University. Countless newspaper The first hint that we might be perceiving women leaders as unpleasant even if they are not comes from Wikipedia itself. Before making the transition to leadership and Label B, members of the club of first female leaders often turn out to have been described with Label A. Before ascending to the chancellorship, Merkel was called "das M dchen" -- "the girl" -- by her mentor, witch" because Merkel and Gandhi changed personalities, or Did "das M dchen" become "Iron Frau" and "dumb doll" become "old because the mantle of leadership changed how they were seen? manipulative, those terms get attached to female leaders for no While individuals of both sexes can be cold, pushy, conniving and better reason than that they happen to be female leaders, said New York University organizational psychologist Madeline Heilman: "Just knowing they are successful and competent causes people to infer they have engaged in all these behaviors and to disapprove of them." In the simplest experimental demonstration of the phenomenon, Heilman recently asked a group of volunteers to evaluate two leaders, a man and a woman. She devised two descriptions of Without the volunteers' knowledge, Heilman regularly interchanged the names of the leaders in the descriptions. For each description, half the volunteers thought they were hearing about an executive named James, while the other half heard exactly the same description applied to an executive called Andrea. The volunteers were asked two simple questions: to decide which leader seemed less likable, and whether they would prefer James or Andrea as a boss. Nearly three-quarters of the volunteers said they thought Andrea was less likable than James. More than four- fifths chose James as a boss. Women showed the same bias as men: Andrea seemed less likable merely because she was a female Heilman's finding, published earlier this year in the Journal of Applied Psychology, replicates the conclusions of other studies. But in a twist that may well have a bearing on Clinton's campaign, Heilman proved that the reason people see a highly competent woman as less likable than a man with precisely the same qualifications is that such women are automatically perceived to have lost their feminine, caring side. When Heilman added elements to her descriptions that showed James and Andrea were especially warm and caring people, the psychological bias disappeared entirely. Equal numbers of volunteers now said they would be happy to have either Andrea or James be their leader.

CONTEXT	 The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) have won a total of 217 seats in the new 601-member constituent assembly, which is expected to sit for the first time in coming weeks and abolish "The Maoists have got 29.27 percent of the total votes and the Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist- Leninist) received 21.13 and 20.33 per cent respectively," Shrestha said. The Congress -- traditionally the dominant party in the Himalayan nation -- took just 107 seats in the April 10 polls, election officials also said. Gyanendra's late brother Birendra in 1990 agreed to a new democratic constitution, and multi-party elections were held in 1991. Since then the country has had more than a dozen governments. landmark polls gave the ultra- leftists a resounding victory."The monarchy will be abolished swiftly after final results from first meeting of the constituent assembly will definitely end the monarchy and there will not be any compromise on this," Maoist leader Prachanda told journalists. The former rebel chief, who goes by one name, spoke after meeting foreign ambassadors and UN officials as he prepared to take charge of the new government. Prachanda, meaning the fierce one, appealed to Washington to remove them from the US list of terrorist organisations. The Maoists, who fought a bloody insurgency that ended in 2006 with 13,000 dead, swept double the number of seats of their nearest rivals and favourites, officials said Thursday. "We completed the nationwide counting of proportional representation late Wednesday night, and the Maoists have emerged well ahead," election commission official Matrika Shrestha told The Maoists had already secured 120 of the 240 seats up for grabs under the first-past-the-post system. Counting for the 335 seats under proportional representation ended late Wednesday with the Maoists securing almost a third of the vote. "This percentage will give the Maoists 97 seats under proportional representation," another election official Yam Bahadur Dura told AFP. King Gyanendra was forced to end a short period of direct rule in April 2006 after mass protests by the Maoists and mainstream parties. Gyanendra began his reign in 2001 under a cloud of grief and suspicion, after nine members of the family of the previous king were killed by a crazed crown prince who then shot himself. In February 2005 the king sacked the government and took direct control of the nation, a move that pushed the mainstream parties into an alliance with their former Maoist enemies. Last December, Nepal's interim parliament agreed that the monarchy would be formally abolished in the first meeting of the assembly, before the body goes on to re-write Nepal's constitution. The elections were a central strand of the 2006 historic peace deal the Maoists signed with mainstream parties, ending the decade-long insurgency. Maoists vow swift exit for Nepal king after poll victory by Sam Taylor Nepal's Maoists pledged Thursday that the world's last Hindu "We want to establish new diplomatic relationships with the US government and get support from them to build a new Nepal. I hope the US will reconsider consider their policy," Prachanda said. Nepal had a brief flirtation with democracy in 1960, but that ended two years later when a new constitution was drawn up under which the monarch exercised sole power.

Singapore will take on co-hosts Indonesia, Myanmar and one of the qualifiers in Group A as they hope to extend their unbeaten run of 15 games in the tournament. Thailand, who have splashed out to hire former Sunderland boss Peter Reid as their new coach, were drawn in Group B alongside 2007 Asian Cup surprise packets Vietnam,  Malaysia  and a qualifier. The matches will be played in Bangkok. The Lions of Singapore won the tournament for the second time with victory over Indonesia in 2004 and retained the title in a controversial two-legged final against Thailand in early 2007. Singapore took a 2-1 lead after the first leg in a home game that was delayed for more than 10 minutes after the Thai team walked off the park to protest a penalty decision. In the second leg in Bangkok, Pipat Thonkanya gave Thailand a ray of hope with a first half goal that took his side level on aggregate before a wonder strike from Khairul Amri in the 82nd minute sealed the issue for the titleholders. The group games will be played from December 5-10, the semi- finals from December 16 to 21 with the two-legged final on December 24 and 28. Hosts Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, the Philippines and Timor Leste will battle it out for the two remaining spots in the finals in Phnom Penh from October 17-25.

The plane's wreckage came to rest just meters from tall office buildings and Ebrard said many more people would almost certainly have died had the plane hit one of the towers. Civil aviation officials were investigating the cause of the crash.

Amid clouds of smoke they place bets that start at $1,300 per hand and can rise to more than $250,000.

Zebari said he expected the gathering would mark "an important turning point in these countries' vision" of the situation in Iraq. Officials from states neighboring Iraq, who have been meeting regularly since 2003, agreed in December to hold their next discussions in Baghdad, Zebari has said. But on Monday, Zebari was phoning several regional foreign ministers to try to persuade them to attend, his office said in a statement. Arab diplomats said several of the neighbors have asked the Iraqi government to postpone the conference. "Some parties prefer to postpone the meeting for a while," said Hesham Youssef, a senior official at the Cairo-based Arab League.

Iran, a staunch supporter of the Shiite-led government in Baghdad, has not said definitively whether it will send its foreign minister to the meeting, but Tehran has so far not show diplomats said on Tuesday. Earlier this month, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said that Iraq wants the meeting to help change how neighbors view the strife-torn country and enlist their assistance for government efforts at restoring law and order.

Diplomatic circles in Cairo have speculated that Iraq's Arab On Tuesday, Gheit urged the Iraqi government to engage in "national reconciliation" efforts -- diplomatic shorthand for bringing Sunnis on board.

Led Zeppelin rounded off a year of landmark reformations in early December with a triumphant return to the stage in London 27 years after the band split in 1980, following the death of drummer John Bonham. Most fans had assumed they would never take the stage together again -- but in September they announced the reunion for a tribute to Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, who signed the But Led Zeppelin, musical trailblazers the first time round, were far from being original in 2007, when a slew of leading names from the past four decades reformed to great acclaim. The Police surprised by announcing their reunion after more than 20 years apart, though most fans believed personal resentments at the heart of the group would prevent a comeback. Singer Sting and drummer Stewart Copeland once came to blows during a tour of the United States and had reportedly refused to be in the same studio together while recording a "best of" album in 1986. Mellowed by age and doubtless aware of the immensely lucrative nature of making- up, the band launched a world tour in May, set to continue into 2008. (minus Peter Gabriel) for a giant tour, Lou Reed was back Phil Collins too joined up with his Genesis band mates again performing, and Van Halen announced concerts for the first time in 22 years with original singer David Lee Roth. The Sex Pistols played a concert in London on November 8 and Black Sabbath under the name of Heaven and Hell and The Eagles were also part of the so-called "heritage act" revival. Sly and the Family Stone, The Who, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, and what remains of The Doors, also headed once more for the road, drawing fans to often expensively priced concerts for an opportunity to relive the past. Elsewhere in 2007, the music and tribulations of British soul singer Amy Winehouse were a source of fascination for the public and a talking point in the industry. The 24-year-old Londoner won awards for her scintillating soul music, reminiscent of the best Motown classics, but her drug abuse and problems with the police meant her private life cast a In the United States, Kanye West confirmed himself as the hottest American hip hop star of the moment after outselling 50 Cent in a highly publicised battle between the two artists who released albums on the same day. Other highlights included the discovery of Mika, a US-Lebanese singer based in London, who shot to fame with his first album of Freddie Mercury-style 80s pop, and the return of Pete Doherty. Doherty -- former singer of British rock group The Libertines, boyfriend of model Kate Moss and another British star with serious drug problems -- released a critically acclaimed second But the return of old reunited bands was the news that made the headlines, and the reasons appeared two-fold, with Neil Young's famous saying "Rock and Roll Will Never Die" and Frank Zappa's hit album "We're Only in It For the Money" offering clues. "Over the last couple of years it seems more acceptable for reunions to happen," said the editor-in-chief of British music magazine Classic Rock, Scott Rowley. "There was a certain stigma before because it might be embarrassing or seemed like they (the artists) were looking back," he said. "The second reason for the reunions is there's "If you believe the record labels, where the real money lies now is in touring. Record sales are down so bands are making a vast proportion of income from touring," he added. Tickets and merchandising are usually priced at a premium given the "one-off" nature of reunions, and taking advantage of the older more wealthy demographics of the fans. Seeing elderly rockers back on stage, minus some hair and appetite for late nights, appeared to inspire others from the more modern era in 2007. The Verve, Rage Against the Machine, The Happy Mondays, The Smashing Pumpkins, My Bloody Valentine, Jesus and The Mary Chain and, lest one forget, The Spice Girls, were among leading groups from the 1980s and 1990s to reform. Alexis Petridis, chief music writer for Britain's The Guardian newspaper, summed up how former stars upstaged newcomers this year with his thoughts on Britain's Glastonbury festival, one of the biggest music events in the world. "There was something troubling about returning home with the knowledge that the most exciting, unpredictable, iconoclastic thing you saw all weekend was not a thrilling new artist, but a Other possible reunions include 70s rockers Rod Stewart and The Faces, 80s heroes Guns and Roses, The Smiths or The Jam.

The 1977 elections were characterized by "the lack of democratic traditions, the permanent presence of factors of instability and the naiveness of many politicians," journalist Augusto Delkader It took three days for the results to be known, reportedly because of the lack of experience in holding democratic elections. The leader of the UCD, Adolfo Suarez who today suffers from Alzheimer's, became Spain's first democratically-elected prime minister after Franco's dictatorship. King Juan Carlos had appointed Suarez to the head of a caretaker government following Franco's death.

But despite the success of the transition to democracy, Spain remains sharply divided between right and left. The right accuses Zapatero's Socialist government of "breaking the spirit of the transition" by opening the wounds of the past, especially with its law aimed at rehabilitating the memory of the victims of the 1936-1939 Civil War and Franco's 36-year dictatorship.

The unstable dam had been created by eruptions of the 2,797-metre Mt Ruapehu in 1995 and 1996 and an emergency plan had been in place for years to deal with the expected lahar.

The lack of casualties and damage was in contrast to a similar lahar on Christmas Eve 1953, which killed 151 train passengers when a rail bridge was swept away.

CONTEXT	 The group, including its feared Young Communist League, has been accused of using threats and violence to intimidate voters. The country's biggest parties, the centrist Nepali Congress and the leftist Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) -- which is communist in name only -- are expected to grab the lion's share of seats. "There should be no violence against any political party workers and voters," said Ian Martin, the head of the UN peace mission in Nepal. The Maoists' transition from feared guerrilla outfit to mainstream party has not been smooth, and they have come in for a barrage of criticism for their conduct in the lead-up to the polls. Violence-hit Nepal ups security ahead of polls Authorities in Nepal stepped up security on Tuesday after a string of bomb blasts hit campaigning for crucial polls expected to lead to the abolition of the Himalayan nation's monarchy. Nepal's Maoists blamed backers of King Gyanendra for the blasts, accusing them of attempting to derail Thursday's polls to elect an assembly whose first task will be to turn Nepal into a to disrupt the constituent assembly elections," said Ananta, "It's a last-ditch effort by royalists and Hindu fundamentalists deputy commander of the Maoist's People's Liberation Army. As part of the landmark peace deal, the UN was invited to assist in monitoring Maoist soldiers confined to camps around the country and help with the elections. who they are voting for," said Martin, taking a swipe at the voting, that this will be a secret election and no-one will know former rebels following reports of widespread intimidation. Government officials said they were ready to deal with any violence in the country, one of the world's 10 poorest. Helicopter patrols have been launched nationwide for unusual movements of people and tens of thousands of extra police officers are in place. The polls, the climax of a 2006 peace deal that ended a decade- long Maoist revolt aimed at ousting the monarchy, will be the most watched in Nepal's history. The vote's run-up has seen daily clashes between supporters of all major parties, and on Monday, bombings in the capital Kathmandu and the ethnically tense southern town of Birginj "Given a choice we would like peace. Our form of struggle has changed," the ultra-leftist's second-in-command Baburam Bhattarai told AFP. King Gyanendra has been keeping a low profile ahead of the election. He was never a popular ruler, having assumed the throne in 2001 after much-loved former king Birendra and most of the rest of the family were massacred by a drunk, drug-fuelled crown prince. His survival of the "palace massacre" has led many Nepalis to believe he was somehow complicit. He lost even more support when he dismissed the government and assumed absolute power to fight Gyanendra has already been stripped of most of his authority but die-hard royalists have warned his ouster could plunge Nepal back into civil war. The bombings "are a tactic to instil fear in people," Modraj Dottel, Nepal's home ministry spokesman, told AFP. On Tuesday, Carter met Nepal's Maoist leaders -- still classed by Washington as foreign "terrorists" -- who assured him that they were committed to peaceful polls.

With roaring growth expected to continue this year, Macau is poised to overtake all of Nevada as the biggest gambling jurisdiction, after it surpassed the Las Vegas Strip last year. industry that until 2002 was a monopoly controlled by Ho. In The phenomenal growth is also driving rapid changes to an December, Ho's SJM Holdings, operator of his flagship Lisboa and Grand Lisboa casinos, was beaten to the top place in revenue for the first time. Las Vegas Sands, which owns the Sands Macau and Analysts predicted that Las Vegas Sands would maintain its lead in the Macau market this year because of the popularity of the Venetian and because of its success in winning more wealthy gamblers. The Venetian, a resort casino, opened in August on the setback for Ho, who has been having trouble with his attempt to A slip into second place in revenue share would be another list a 25 percent stake of SJM in Hong Kong, with the goal of raising about $1 billion. The listing has been hindered by a legal dispute between Ho and his sister Winnie over the ownership of shares in Sociedade de Torismo e Diversoes de Macau, SJM's parent company. Although Ho controls 18 of the 27 casinos in Macau, most of them are relatively small and vulnerable to determined efforts from new American and Hong Kong casino operators to win wealthy the whole year," Fong said. "Traditionally, SJM has relied on its "In 2008, it's very likely SJM will fall into second place for VIP room operation. If you look at the proportion of gaming revenue, more than 70 percent came from VIP rooms. Now it's more competitive." local gambling industry. Booming property and share markets in Fong said wealthy customers were driving the sharp growth in the mainland China and Hong Kong, along with the opening of resorts that adopt the style of Las Vegas, like the Venetian, are drawing wealthy gamblers from around the world. Casinos in Macau rely heavily on table games for their revenue, in contrast to Las Vegas, which gets the majority of its gambling revenue from slot machines. The critical role of the VIP customer for Macau's casinos is evident in revenue figures for 2006. VIP Baccarat, the main game played by high-stakes gamblers in Macau, accounted for about two- thirds of the 56.6 billion patacas in revenue from games of fortune, according to the gambling inspection bureau. David Green, a casino consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers in Macau, said growth of this scale would give Macau more than the combined gambling revenues of Las Vegas and Reno, Nev. "The implications are that some of the focus that has traditionally been on Las Vegas might shift further to Macau," Green said. In 2007, gambling revenue in Nevada was $12.8 billion, an increase of 2.8 percent from the previous year. A number of new casinos and resorts are set to open in Macau over the next two years. This development, most of it taking place on the Cotai Strip, will propel growth by attracting visitors other than hard-core gamblers from the mainland and Hong Kong. The emergence of resort-style casinos, however, is also going to heighten competition for the VIP business and change the face of the industry. While the size of the pie might increase, analysts said that so would the battle to win the business of so-called junket operators that largely control the flow of top-flight customers. "Unavoidably the competition is going to intensify," said Gavin Ho, the head of Hong Kong and China research of the gambling industry at the investment firm CLSA.

Most industry analysts say they expect Macau's gambling industry to maintain strong growth over the next three years, with estimates for the increase this year varying from 20 percent to the U.S. casinos, in particular. But we can also expect the competitive pressure to increase in Macau."

"I don't think any other religion other than Christianity would have been treated so badly," the 55-year-old, from Twickenham, west London, was quoted as saying by Britain's domestic Press Association news agency.

Britain's Home Secretary John Reid said in December that he was "sick and tired" of "mad political correctness" and cited BA's policy as an example.

CONTEXT	Various European countries announced at the weekend that they had  banned use of the test made by US drug manufacturer Abbott Laboratories. Others recommended the test should be used only in conjunction with other screening. Abbott warned laboratories to stop using the test, the most widely used in Britain since it came on to the market in September, on March 29. In Paris, the French health ministry announced it had withdrawn the Abbott test from the market on March 28. But it added that "the problem was settled" as France used two consecutive tests for detecting AIDS, so those submitted to the Abbott method would not undergo further screening. In Italy, the government issued a decree on Wednesday withdrawing the Abbott test, and health authorities said measures were underway to repeat tests. Authorities in Denmark and Norway have advised health officials not to use the Abbott test. The Swedish health ministry has not banned it, but has written to labs asking them not to rely on the Abbott test alone. German authorities claimed that of 650,000 Abbott tests, none so far had proved to be defective, and only one of the 16 federal states Hessen said on Thursday that blood tests would be re-analysed. In Portugal, authorities began withdrawing five types of test marketed by Abbott at the end of last week, an official from the national institute of pharmacy and medicines said.

According to the Discovery Channel (the folks who bring you Shark Week), a single shark tooth can exert a pressure of 132 pounds. Since this is spread over a large area (remember, lots of teeth), a shark\u2019s jaws would exert a pressure of about 3 tons (more than 6,000 pounds), Dr. Brady Barr of the National Geographic Channel measured this for the documentary Dangerous Encounters: Bite Force: A domestic dog has a bite force of 317 pounds.

Advancing from the first qualifying round, Slaven is currently enjoying every moment it has had in the UEFA Cup, but coach Krunoslav Jurcic told the official UEFA Web site that he is trying to keep his players' feet on the ground. "Football is very popular in the city again, but I am trying to decrease that euphoria," he said. "It's not easy when such a big team is coming to the city. My philosophy is to play aggressively and be brave and I told my players that they have to be like this against Galatasaray." Though it lifted the cup in 2000, Galatasaray's latest memories in the UEFA Cup were not pleasant at all, as Norwegian minnow Tromso knocked out the Lions in the first round of the 2005/ 06 The home team may pose problems for Galatasaray, while three of Galatasaray's stars will not be playing as Lincoln, Tobias Linderoth and Arda Turan are all injured. However, Galatasaray has a remarkable record of not being beaten in the preliminary rounds in European Cups. Of all the 22 games played, the Lions won 17 times and drew five times. Meanwhile, Kayseri Erciyesspor is playing Maccabi Tel Aviv. Erciyesspor had a successful run in the second half of the Turkcell Super League last year but that was not enough to avoid relegation. However, then coach Bulent Korkmaz's tight defending mentality made them runners up in the Turkish Cup to grant them a berth in this year's UEFA Cup. Now, Erciyesspor have lost many players and the coach, which means it is far away from the hard-fighting team that it was just three months ago. Club chairman Enver Kemaloglu thought that this young squad might be an advantage for Erciyesspor and they will fight till the last minute. Erciyesspor is the second Turkish team to play in Europe while competing in the lower divisions since Mersin Idman Yurdu's heyday in the Cup Winners Cup in 1983. After a goalless draw at home, Mersin Idman Yurdu was beaten 1-0 by Spartak Varna in Bulgaria and eliminated from the cup. season.

CONTEXT	 Czech industry minister faults Commission carbon quota figures Czech Industry Minister Martin Riman Thursday attacked the grounds on which the European Commission has slashed the country's future greenhouse gas emissions quota. Unveiling the main findings of an analysis of the decision in late March to cut the Czech carbon emissions quota by 14.8 percent to an annual 86.8 million tonnes between 2008 and 2012, Riman said the commission had "seriously underestimated" future Czech economic growth for 2009 and 2010. 3.6 percent, the average estimate of local institutions such as "While the commission for both years counts on growth of around the Czech National Bank and Czech Statistical Office is one percentage point higher," Riman said, adding that the finance ministry counts on 5.1 percent growth. The commission also unfairly factored in the future trend of Czech transport and domestic emissions of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, although the EU's quota system is targeted at forcing major industrial pollutors to cut their emissions. The commission's projections of Czech growth and pollution were based on preparation work by Athen's National Technical University, which at no stage consulted the Czech Statistical Office or his own ministry, Riman added.

On Monday, declaring a legislative emergency, hundreds of members of the California Nurses Association marched on the capital in Sacramento and pledged to continue to campaign for universal health- care coverage. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would revolution.

So nurses are  taking their demands to statehouses and Nurses have come a long way since the late 1980s, when hospitals Among the largely female ranks of nurses the figure is closer to one in five. Another 85,000 nurses belong to the Service Employees International Union, which touts itself as the nation's fastest growing union and is focused on organizing the nation's 10 million non-union healthcare workers, from home health aides to hospital nurses.

Sunday's Governor Roland Koch of Hesse and Christian Wulff of Lower Saxony elections are being viewed as a major test for the CDU and its partner in a fractious national "grand coalition," the Social Democrats. ARD and ZDF television projections, based on exit polls and  partial results, put support for the CDU in Hesse at between 36 and 36.5 percent, with the Social Democrats, or SPD, at up to 37.2 percent. Ypsilanti pushed a popular demand for a national minimum wage, which the CDU opposes, and better education -- reflecting her party's recent national drive to strengthen its left-wing credentials. "We would have liked a better result in Hesse," CDU general secretary Ronald Pofalla said in Berlin, acknowledging "significant" losses. Wulff ran a far less polarizing campaign than Koch and faced a weaker SPD challenge.

CONTEXT	 Thus far in dealing with top-level personnel, Dr. Bob Gates has been like a stealth bomber. Unseen, unheard, unfeeling _ just the way a CIA man likes it. Perhaps the next carefully worded news release that comes from Texas A &M president Robert Gates' office will announce Air America as the new official airline for Aggies team charters. Perhaps official news of the Aggies' new football hire will arrive via smoke signals from Gates' on-campus home: Gates, the former CIA director, is making bold changes and settling for nothing less than excellence, all right. But he is pushing buttons and turning dials from his office as if it were a bunker and world As for the rest of us _ particularly Aggies alumni and fans _ we are left guessing if Gates means what he says or means what he doesn't say. Old habits are hard to break, sure. But Gates should have done better than end Slocum's 30 years of coaching service to the university with a one-page release. Gates didn't stand in front of the public to address the change, as he should have. He didn't answer questions or explain obvious contradictions he made to A&M alumni, as he should have. That's not to say the coaching change in Aggieland shouldn't or wouldn't have happened anyway. Neither is it to say Gates ultimately will not be what many Aggies believe he will be, which is a brilliant leader with vision, capable of taking Texas A&M to greater And of course, Gates is a busy man. Dropping the ax on the two most powerful men in the athletic department _ Wally Groff and Slocum _ while running a public university is tough work. But clearly, after 27 years of working in the CIA, Gates continues to hold The Company's clandestine tactics dear. Too dear. In his former life, Gates rarely had to answer to anyone. But at a pre-eminent public institution like A&M, he should answer to everyone. At the least, Gates should stand before the public and explain why everything he said previously about Slocum's job status being in the hands of the new athletic director was contradicted with Monday's firing of Slocum. On Tuesday, Gates merely issued written statements in response to questions posed by the media through a spokesperson. He has yet to answer any questions face-to-face. It has since become apparent that by firing Slocum himself, Gates took the bullet for the incoming athletic director, relieving the new guy of having to make his first move the firing of an Aggies icon. But when Gates arrived in the Brazos Valley and announced he would be an ``agent of change,'' little did we know he meant secret agent. When Gates gave Slocum a vote of confidence in November, little did we know we'd need a decoder ring to understand what Gates really meant was only that his ``intention'' was to allow the new AD to make the This move was Gates' decision, start to finish. The hiring of Nebraska's Bill Byrne as athletic director is all his, too. The Groff decision was all Gates'. None of the more than 100,000 former A&M students expects Gates to divulge names and phone numbers for the head coaching prospects. But the public and specifically Aggies fans deserve a little insight into why Gates has more than once said one thing and done another. How'd you like to be the next coach _ or professor, for that matter _ who earns a written vote of confidence from the university president? Gates has sent a troubling message to every employee of the university that his words might not be worth the invisible ink used to pen them. Slocum's 30-year career deserved more than a one-page release. The

At an important pan-Arab summit held in Cairo, Egypt, last June, Arab leaders went on record to support the peace process but warned that if the then newly elected Netanyahu abandoned the ``land-for-peace'' principle, there would be a corresponding withdrawal on the Arab side. Nine months later, Arab governments say they have lost faith in Netanyahu's commitment to peace; meanwhile, they are under mounting pressure from their populations to move beyond verbal protests and ``Jerusalem is sensitive,'' said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa at the summit in Rabat. ``We cannot accept this way of dealing with the issue.'' Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat was in the Moroccan capital for the summit, a meeting of the 15-member Jerusalem Committee of the Islamic Conference Organization, that was called to debate a united Arab response. The meeting was being chaired by Morocco's King Hassan, a leader who in the past has been friendly toward Israel. Ross spent two hours with Arafat there, delivering a letter from President Clinton whose contents were not disclosed and taking in the Palestinian leader's views of the current crisis. Then he flew to Israel, where a meeting was scheduled at around midnight at the Jerusalem home of Netanyahu. In Washington, Clinton said Ross was ``encouraged'' by his talks with Arafat. But the president declined to drop even a hint on the substance of the meeting. proceeding now on his trip, and I don't have anything else to tell Ross ``had a very good meeting with Chairman Arafat and he's you,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House. it absolutely clear that he does not support violence.

The official Syrian newspaper Tishreen in an editorial Thursday said Arab countries are waiting for something new from Ross and the Clinton administration -- ``an honest position that takes into consideration the necessity of establishing a just peace and not to cover up Israel's aggressive policies.''

The resolution is meant to build on a weekend statement passed in Islamabad by the Islamic Conference Organization, which represents 54 states and about 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide. The IOC urged Islamic states to ``review relations with Israel and make them contingent on progress achieved in the peace process.''

CONTEXT	 "The People's Republic of China does not represent the 23 million Taiwanese people who deserve proper representation at the UN, who deserve to apply for membership with equal status." Taiwan, under its official name the Republic of China, lost its UN seat to China in 1971. Its efforts in the past 14 years to rejoin the world body using the name have been repeatedly blocked At a meeting in Australia ahead of the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit, Hu said the move could destabilise the region and urged Bush to issue a stern warning to "President Hu Jintao stressed that this year and next year is going to be a highly sensitive and possibly dangerous period of the situation in the Taiwan Straits," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters. "He said that in disregard of the warnings and objections of the relevant parties, the Taiwan authorities wantonly push for the (referendum) for the membership of Taiwan in the United Nations," press ahead with the poll despite opposition from Washington and Independence-leaning Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian has vowed to Beijing, which regards the island as part of its territory awaiting reunification. "We also don't want to see this blown up too big. We don't want to see anyone provoked by the actions of the Taiwanese, so for the moment we're going to stay with our position and continue to exert our good influence on the Taiwanese to see if we can change In Taipei, Chen reacted angrily, blasting China -- one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- for repeatedly thwarting its UN bid. "Due to China's ruthless boycott and suppression, Taiwan cannot become a member of the UN," Chen said in a video conference with the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think tank. China and Taiwan have been separated since the end of a civil war in 1949 but Beijing insists that Taiwan not make any move towards independence and wants reunification, by force if necessary. US, China join forces to warn Taiwan over UN bid Bush, whose country has for decades supplied Taiwan with weaponry to defend itself from any possible attack from China, told Hu he too is worried about the move. Only 24 countries formally recognise Taipei over Beijing as China exerts growing pressure on Taiwan's friends and on international meetings not to recognise the island as a country.

CONTEXT	 UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali convened the Security Council to review the financial hardships that have forced the organization to cut back its peacekeeping operations around the world, The meeting Monday at the UN chief's offices here focused on a controversial letter he sent the Council last week recommending that the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) pull out of former Yugoslavia. Boutros-Ghali stressed that the United Nations is owed almost three billion dollars by its members: one billion towards its administrative budget and some two billion towards ongoing peacekeeping operations. The meeting also reviewed the UN missions in Rwanda, Bosnia- Hercegovina, Haiti and Mozambique, among other issues, diplomats said. The Council authorized on Sunday a possible multinational, military intervention to restore democracy in Haiti, led and financed by the United States. A 6,000-strong UN Mission in Haiti would eventually replace the international force, once stability is restored. Boutros-Ghali estimated that a six-month stint in Haiti would cost the UN around 216 The UN's hardships were also the focus of another meeting in New York Monday between the United Nations and regional organizations. Boutros-Ghali called on these regional groups to play a more prominant role in settling disputes, monitoring peace treaties and implementing coercive measures around the globe. "It is now clear that the United Nations, by itself, cannot shoulder all the situations threatening peace and international security around the world," the UN chief said in French. Referring specifically to military measures covered by Chapter VII of the UN Charter, Boutros-Ghali said that the world body "lacks the means for large-scale operations," and therefore "should not hesitate to delegate its functions," to other groups, as it has in the case of Attending the meeting were the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Commonwealth, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, the Arab League, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organization of African Unity, the Organization of American States, the Islamic Conference Organization and the Western European Union. diplomats said.

CONTEXT	Offices will also be opened in India, Europe and Latin America  for the first time, said the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Mike Leavitt. US food, drug regulator to open offices in China: official The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will open its first overseas offices in China this year as part of efforts to regulate imported food to the United States, an official said on Thursday. The move reflected the increased globalization of the world's food and drug trade, notably from developing to developed nations, he said. "Opening these offices will mark a key milestone in the globalization of our efforts to enhance the safety of imported food and medical products," he said. Food quality concerns for imported goods are paramount for the FDA after recent high profile cases involving China. The first office will open by the end of 2008 in Beijing, with additional staff to be posted in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in 2009. Over the last month countries around the world have issued recalls and bans of Chinese-made dairy products after high levels of the chemical melamine were detected in exported goods. In total, 46,810 children were hospitalized after drinking milk tainted with melamine, which was added in place of water to increase sales volume. Figures from China's Ministry of Health said 5,824 children were still receiving hospital treatment for kidney diseases due to the tainted products, according to a report from state news agency "The globalization of the food supply and medical product manufacturing has demanded that we do things differently," said FDA Commissioner Andrew C. von Eschenbach. Last year, the US imported more than two trillion dollars worth of products from around 825,000 inmporters. HHS and FDA projections indicate the volume of imports will grow as the international trade continues to multiply. "Increasing our presence overseas will provide greater protections to American consumers at home and benefit our host countries as well," said Leavitt. "We won't have to send our experts to another country to work with foreign governments and regulated industry to improve our oversight -- we'll have staff living there and working on the ground 365 days a year."

CONTEXT	 Amid the riots, about 10,000 protesters from the Communist Party of Greece and the Coalition of the Left marched to protest the teenager's death. Authorities were bracing for potentially more violence in Greece Tuesday as mourners prepared for the funeral of a teenager whose death in a police shooting sparked the worst riots the country has seen in decades. Fifteen-year-old Alexandros Grigoriadis died of a gunshot wound to the chest Saturday night in the often volatile downtown Athens district of Exarchia. Two police officers have been arrested and Within hours of the boy's death, riots erupted in cities across Greece, from Thessaloniki in the north to cities in Crete and the holiday island of Corfu. By early Tuesday, hundreds of stores, cars, banks and buildings in about a dozen cities had been torched, smashed or looted. Gangs of masked and hooded youths screaming "Cops! Pigs! Murderers!" fought pitched street battles with riot police firing volleys of tear gas. Black smoke mingled with clouds of tear gas above central Athens, which saw extensive damage. Broken glass littered the streets. Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, whose increasingly unpopular conservative government has already faced a growing number of sometimes violent demonstrations against economic and education reforms, called for calm Monday. "All the dangerous and unacceptable events that occurred because of the emotions that followed the tragic incident cannot and will not be tolerated," he said in a live televised address. In an outpouring of rage, high school and university students joined self-styled anarchists in attacking police stations, smashing stores and burning buildings. Police said some rioters in central Syntagma Square. Protesters posed for photos in front In Athens, rioters torched the capital's massive Christmas tree of the blaze as others sang "Oh Christmas Tree." Police said rioting was abating in the early hours of Tuesday, although some clashes continued in the center of the capital. Dozens of masked youths were holed up in a university building. The widely televised scenes of destruction are likely to further undermine a government already rocked by financial scandals and clinging to a razor-thin majority of just one seat in the consistently in recent opinion polls for the first time in eight 300-member Parliament. The opposition Socialists have been ahead years, gaining ground on a wave of dissatisfaction. blazes Monday, said department spokesman Nikos Bougioukos. About In the capital alone, the fire department tackled more than 200 100 of the fires were in buildings and the rest were in cars and trash bins used as barricades. "The prime minister has a deep political responsibility. But instead of taking it, he is rejecting the ... resignations of the responsible ministers, he is adopting the version of an isolated incident and barricading himself behind broken storefronts," after which Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos, whose weekend Karamanlis called a late-night emergency Cabinet meeting Monday, offer to resign was rejected, described the riots as "unacceptable." But he insisted police responded as well as they could. Although there is little public support for street violence, there is a deep well of tolerance for demonstrations in Greece, where the right to protest is held dear. Violence often breaks out between riot police and anarchists during demonstrations. The self-styled anarchist movement partly traces its roots in the resistance to Greece's 1967-74 military ATHENS, Greece 2008-12-09 05:28:45 UTC dictatorship.

Germany's six-month presidency of the European Union began earlier this week and Merkel is also chair of the G8 for 2007. Questioned about Europe's reliance on Russian energy imports, Merkel warned that relations between the two must be based on reciprocity.

CONTEXT	 Guerrillas affiliated with the Communist Party of India (Maoist) have some sort of presence in a dozen Indian states, but in Chhattisgarh, where some of India's biggest industrial groups are In the epicenter of the Maoist rebellion in central India, 300 prisoners who were apparently led by Maoists broke out of jail on Sunday evening, the police said. It was unclear to what extent the escape reflected poor policing -- a hallmark of much of rural India, including Chhattisgarh state, where it took place -- or a well-planned jailbreak. Either way, it was a reminder of an insurgency that has spread across the mineral-rich forested center of India and that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described as the biggest internal security threat facing the country. According to the Home Ministry, Maoist violence claimed 950 lives last year, and 451 through the first half of this year. The South Asia Terrorism Portal, an independent research group, tallied 613 dead through Dec. 11, though, and its 2006 toll was lower than the government's. The Maoists, also known as Naxalites here, say they are fighting on behalf of the poor; their goal is to overthrow the state. Chhattisgarh is among India's poorest states, with some of the lowest ratios of police officers to population. The conflict has made matters worse. Villagers, mostly indigenous people, have The police, government officials and politicians are among the Maoists' favored targets, and the rebels usually send civilian supporters to swarm their ill-prepared prey. Last October, rebels in eastern Jharkhand state attacked at a cultural festival and killed the son of a local politician. Last March, rebels stormed a police post, killing 49 officers and recruits, and stealing a cache of weapons.

The communists have said India's Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar can only attend the IAEA's General Assembly as a member of the IAEA board and not to launch But communist parties say the deal allows Washington too much influence over India's foreign policy and threaten its weapons programme. Senior party leaders, who were not identified, told the Press Trust of India news agency earlier Thursday that the Marxists would withdraw support to the government if it proceeded with the Later in the day the party's general secretary appeared to step back from that threat, but continued to strongly warn the government not to implement the agreement. The committee has authorised the party's decision-making polit bureau to "take whatever necessary measures to see that the agreement is not operationalised," he added.

The famed giant portrait of Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong that hangs in Beijing's Tiananmen Square mysteriously caught fire on Saturday, two witnesses said. They said they saw large flames and black smoke billow from the bottom of the portrait as an estimated 100 police scrambled to put out the fire and keep crowds at bay. "When we jumped out of the taxi police immediately told us to leave," said one of the witnesses. "We did not see what happened to start the fire." They said that about 15 percent of the portrait had been burned and blackened. The original portrait of Mao was painted by Zhang Zhenshi in 1950, and it has since served as the model of Mao's likeness for all the portraits that have hung on the Tiananmen Square Rostrum

Marandi described the three as highly qualified and said many believed they were rebuffed because they are vocal critics of American foreign policy.

Other institute officials also did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Meanwhile, the three students' supporters became irate, "It's off," he said. Espionage accusations are part of an increasingly common refrain -- that the Bush administration is using academics to undermine the Islamic system by spreading secular, liberal values.

Fraternity brothers are being accused of hazing, date rape and drug use. Sorority sisters, of promiscuity, pregnancy and eating disorders. They're scared about who will read it, especially parents and future employers. JuicyCampus has taken off a little more slowly at UT, with just a few pages of posts instead of USF's dozen-plus.

Many of the comments made on JuicyCampus.com could be prosecuted as defamatory in court  if the identity of the poster was revealed. But JuicyCampus.com reveals its users only if subpoenaed. The site cooperated with police to identify a student who threatened a campus shooting rampage. Almost all posts are left on the site, no matter how much its subject protests.

Ivester now calls some of the posts he reads "distasteful" and "awful," but refuses to remove most, and says he feels no guilt for the hurt they cause. "I don't see anything wrong or even controversial with the idea that we provide a forum where students can talk about the things that interest them most," he said. Ivester won't say how much money the site has made from the advertising it sells, but says it's still in the red. He's already planning future upgrades.

McCollum has not done spoke of suicide and stalking and sexual predators, and asked so, but a spokeswoman said he is keeping tabs on the New Jersey case.

CONTEXT	 In nominating Robert M. Gates as his next defense secretary, President Bush reached back to an earlier era in Republican foreign policy, one marked more by caution and pragmatism than that of the Born and raised in Wichita, Kan., Robert Michael Gates, whose father sold wholesale auto parts, became an Eagle Scout (he is currently president of the National Eagle Scout Association) and studied President Lyndon Johnson's choice of Clark Clifford, another but he's not arrogant," Inman said. He compared Gates' nomination to unflappable old Washington hand, to replace the lightning rod Robert McNamara as defense secretary in 1968 at the height of the war in Vietnam. during the elder Bush's administration. There, he worked closely with served as deputy to Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, Baker and Condoleezza Rice. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, now the CIA director, also served on the staff of the National Security Council at the time. Soft-spoken but tough-minded, Gates, 63, is in many ways the antithesis of Donald H. Rumsfeld, the brash leader he would succeed. He has been privately critical of the administration's failure to Gates last served in Washington 13 years ago, and Bush made clear on Wednesday that he regarded his nominee as someone who would bring new perspective to the final two years of his tenure. Gates served the first President George Bush as deputy national security adviser and then director of central intelligence. He was not part of the group that advised the current President Bush during his senior official in Rumsfeld's Pentagon who left the administration in confrontation on national security issues," said Dov Zakheim, a former 2004. He described Gates as "a pragmatist and a realist" who would be "no lightning rod." A longtime Soviet analyst who spent two decades at the CIA, Gates Gates was confirmed in 1991 as director of central intelligence after a bruising confirmation fight in which subordinates alleged that he had politicized reporting on the Soviet Union. He has spent the last Only 22 months ago, Gates turned down President Bush's invitation to become the first director of national intelligence. After agonizing for more than two weeks, Gates later recounted, he decided during a But since March, as a member of Baker's Iraq Study Group, Gates has been pondering the central defense policy quandary facing the administration.

Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter and co-author with Gates of the report on Iran policy, said he hoped the appointment would mean "a major corrective in American policy toward the Middle East." If Gates was initially reluctant to return to Washington, it may be because he knows what it means to be at the center of political crossfire. First picked by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 to succeed Casey as director of central intelligence, Gates withdrew in the face of senators' concern that he had not been candid about his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair. also some colleagues' accusation that he had skewed intelligence confirmation hearings involving not only the Iran-Contra affair but reporting on the Soviet Union to suit the Reagan White House. Gates was confirmed in a 61-31 vote as the youngest director of central intelligence in history and oversaw the initial effort to redirect the truth to power," said the former subordinate, Melvin A. Goodman, a harsh assessment. "This is not a person with a history of telling Soviet analyst from 1966 to 1990. Goodman called Gates a micromanager and "not a big-picture person," though he also called him "a hard- working, disciplined person who's totally loyal to his bosses." David Boren, a former Democratic chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, had warm praise for Gates' service. "I found him to be highly intelligent, an excellent manager of the large and complex intelligence community, and totally bipartisan in his approach," Boren Bobby R. Inman, a former deputy director of central intelligence and director of the National Security Agency and an old friend of Gates, called him "a good listener" who, "after he makes up his mind, is very decisive." "He's impatient with those whose minds don't move as fast as his does, A hint of the approach Gates might bring to the job, drawing on his experience at the end of the Cold War, can be found in his remarks in 2004 at the release of the Council on Foreign Relations report, called in terms of nongovernmental organizations being able to operate in "One of our recommendations is that the U.S. government lift its ban Iran," Gates said. "Greater interaction between Iranians and the rest of the world," he said, "sets the stage for the kind of internal change that we all hope will happen there."

CONTEXT	 LOS ANGELES - California's efforts to expand health care to all residents have drawn sharp warnings from the medical community that the increased demand for services will overrun a system "We graduate about 6,000 nurses a year in the schools in California," said Jim Lott, executive vice president of the Hospital Association of Southern California, which represents 190 medical centers. "We need to literally double that amount to California hospitals already have about 14,000 vacancies for registered nurses -- about 35 openings at each hospital. That shortage is expected to grow to nearly 50,000 by 2010. 10,000 -- which is expected to double over the next two decades, The Los Angeles area has the greatest nurse shortage -- about according to a recent report by the Center for California Health Workforce Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. medical education at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the Parker, senior associate dean for student affairs and graduate University of California, Los Angeles. Among his solutions is a $90 million California Nurse Education Initiative unveiled in 2005 to help colleges expand nursing education. Dr. Anmol S. Mahal, president of the California Medical Association that represents 35,000 doctors, said the governor's plan for expanded health care does not adequately address The governor's plan to offer health care to all Californians would impose new charges on doctors, hospitals and employers to expand coverage to an estimated 6.5 million uninsured residents. The plans proposed by Nuñez and Perata focus on covering working Californians, rather than all residents, and would impose no fees on employers who don't provide employee coverage. Kuehl's plan calls for a single-payer universal system into which all Californians would pay. They would receive coverage through a new government agency. Charles Idelson, spokesman for the 75,000-member California Nurses Association, said the association supports Kuehl's plan because it would not exacerbate the nursing shortage. "We, in California, have never trained enough physicians for our own needs," Mahal said. "We have been net importers of physicians from other states and from the rest of the world. In the past, that import was easy to sustain because we have the California lifestyle and the great weather to attract people. "Unfortunately, it's not working as well now. California has some disadvantages. Physician reimbursements are lower, and physician incomes are lower in California than (in) other parts of the California is the most populous state in the nation, yet it ranks 39th in the nation in the number of medical students per capita at 16 medical students per 100,000 people.

CONTEXT	 S&P sees Macau casinos overtaking Las Vegas but warns of risks ahead Credit-rating agency Standard and Poor's said Tuesday it is bullish on Macau's booming casinos, whose earnings would overtake those of all of Las Vegas' gaming centres within four years. "We expect growth in Macau to remain in double digits for several years to come," said S and P director of corporate infrastructure ratings, Mary Ellen Olson, explaining that compound growth over S and P estimates that Macau's casino revenue will top 6.4 billion US dollars for 2006, a growth rate in excess of 15 percent and already above earnings on the Las Vegas Strip. "In the next three to four years, taking into account the growth differentials, we think Macau will overtake all of Las Vegas," said Craig Parmelee, managing director of ratings services. Official figures are expected later in the week from the Macau tourism authority. As Macau is the only Chinese city where gambling is legal, S and P expects tourism arrivals to continue to grow in the near future. reclaimed land, will become a major focus of the industry in It also believes the Cotai Strip, a gaming district rising on Macau. Macau's casino sector has rocketed since a law passed in 2001 stripped tycoon Stanley Ho os his 40-year monopoly on casino operations in the former Portuguese enclave. While Macau's success was built on strong fundamentals, Olson also cautioned it could all unravel in the face of several risks.

Taiwan angrily severed diplomatic ties with Costa Rica Thursday and accused Beijing of using chequebook diplomacy to lure its allies after the Central American state said it had established relations with China. Huang accused Arias, a Nobel peace prize winner in 1987, of ditching Taipei in favour of an authoritarian Beijing. "Since taking office in May 2006, President Arias has ignored the shared values and long-term friendship between our two countries to conduct multiple negotiations with China," he said. President Chen Shui-bian rejected Huang's offer to resign to take responsibility, saying the foreign ministry had tried its best to maintain ties. Chen accused Beijing of resorting to "dollar diplomacy" against Taipei and said the latest diplomatic battle demonstrated Beijing's persistent efforts to isolate Taiwan in the "China has pledged a grant of 130 million US dollars to Costa Rica and a procurement of bonds worth 300 million US dollars," a cost Taiwan's leader said "we cannot afford."

The Maoists swept eight out of 10 constituencies in the hill- ringed Kathmandu capital region, a traditional bastion of the monarchy.

CONTEXT	AUSTIN, Texas -- "I have no retirement skills," says Bill Moyers,  who ended his PBS career in 2004 and again in 2006 - but returns with a new documentary series next week. Nobody has ever accused Moyers of not being serious. A flaming liberal, maybe, but never shallow. He is intense and determined, perhaps deceptively so because of his soft Texas twang and easy- going manner. Witness the latest incarnation of "Bill Moyers Journal," which debuts Wednesday, Apr. 25, before shifting to its regular time slot Fridays. The 90-minute film examines the role of the press in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq. Suffice it to say Moyers Among the burning questions pondered in the film: Why was evidence disputing the existence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction ignored by so many? Why did journalists accept without question the Bush administration's claim of a link "I'm very careful in the documentary not to blame everyone, but enough mainstream journalists did suspend their skepticism and buy into the administration's marketing of the war that they took Moyers sees this lack of skepticism about White House proclamations on Iraq as "a paradigm shift in the role of journalists in democracy." Independent analysis of information, made vulnerable. In a time of crisis, there's a tendency to see "The impact was profound," Moyers says. "We were all shocked and the president as doing no wrong, and a lot of people 'put on the uniform' because we saw it to be a national emergency." interviewed in Moyers' report, by the way, along with Bob Simon eyed with passionate patriotism. Those two journalists are of "60 Minutes" and Walter Isaacson, former president of CNN. Questions about the lack of journalistic scrutiny have been raised by others recently, too. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who uncovered the Watergate scandal for the Washington Post, "There is a tendency to think the truth lies between Democratic and Republican opinions," Moyers says. "But that means facts are orphans." In the aftermath of the Iraq invasion, Moyers believes some lessons have been learned. He sees more skepticism about tensions building up between the United States and Iran, for example, and he thinks the immediacy of bloggers who question official Much has been made about the declining ratings and quality of TV news. The evening newscasts are in a slump, and most of the prime-time newsmagazines are true-crime and sex-predator stories. us who believe in helping people get as close as possible to the from quality journalism," says Moyers. "In the meantime, those of verifiable truth have to engage in a guerrilla action." Future episodes of the new "Moyers Journal" will focus on politics, arts, culture, media and the economy. Next up: an in- depth look at the U.S. prosecutors scandal that continues to rock guerrilla warfare. Born in Oklahoma, he grew up in Marshall, For those who don't know, Moyers' background hardly smacks of Texas, graduated from UT, started his TV career at KTBC, became an ordained Baptist minister, worked for the Peace Corps, became President Johnson's press secretary and, in his post-LBJ and pre- mainstream, Moyers is credentialed. It's good to have him back in If it's important to live in the mainstream to criticize the the hunt for hard news and tough truth.

After visits from President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Treasury undersecretary Stuart Levey, UAE officials have dramatically reduced the number of business licenses to Iranian citizens, according to US officials and a Globe analysis of Less than 1 percent of the 10,800 businesses registered in Dubai during the first three months of 2008 had an Iranian partner, according to an analysis of statistics from Dubai Chamber of US officials have praised the recent actions of the UAE, seeing the crackdown as a victory for US policy, which seeks to use economic pressure to persuade Iran's regime to halt its "The UAE is taking steps to be vigilant," said Levey, a key architect of the banking sanctions, who has traveled to Dubai eight times about the issue. "They have a challenge there and they are starting to grapple with it." businesses owned by individual Iranians who have no political connected to the regime, the policy also punishes small connections and are often at odds with their government. The Iranian regime issues lucrative monopolies to a vast empire of parastatal companies, and controls an estimated 85 percent of Iran's economy. But many of the Iranian businesses in Dubai are run by small traders from Iran's tiny, struggling private sector that is often at odds with officials in Tehran. against Bank Melli and Bank Saderat, two top Iranian banks where But the real blow came in October, when Bush announced sanctions the company kept its funds.

For example, a Globe reporter tracked down a senior official for the state- owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines - which was sanctioned this week by the US Treasury - working out of the office of an Indian shipping company. US officials say they have tried to design sanctions that will hit the Iranian regime, not ordinary citizens. But they acknowledge that innocent Iranian entrepreneurs have been hurt by the sanctions. US officials say the new hardships are hitting the entire Iranian economy and sparking debate in Iran about whether the nuclear program is worth the price. Many Iranians expressed bitterness against Washington for their loss of status in the United Arab Emirates, where about 40 percent of locals trace their ancestry to Iran. Iranian traders, who helped transform Dubai from a desert backwater into a But Kamyar Houbakht, a Web developer who grew up in Dubai, says he experienced a new feeling of discrimination when he applied to open a business with a British partner.

CONTEXT	 We prepare for hurricanes. We prepare for floods. But workplace violence? Not really. The multiple killings at Virginia Tech this week has put a new focus on the need for companies to be ready in case someone comes to work armed and dangerous. But many companies have not done enough to prepare. Management at Rice University, said that each year he assigns his nearly a decade at the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of students to contact a company and ask about its disaster preparations. That would include a list of whom to notify, which can include the police and government regulators, and then how to put a team in place to deal with the situation. Over the past nine years of hearing his students report on what they found, Hemeyer estimates that only one out of five companies is prepared. But there are limits to what a company can do to control what happens on its premises. "We live in a free society and people come in and out, which is difficult to control," said Joel Tietjens, whose company T-jens &amp; T-jens in Spring provides consulting and seminars on use anonymously. This would allow workers to alert company Hemeyer recommends setting up a toll-free line that employees can officials if a co-worker is acting strange or complaining about a threatening ex-spouse. A grievance resolution program that allows employees and customers discuss their problems also helps to defuse anger, Bangs said. It's also important to put out a memo every six to 12 months reminding employees that the company has a crisis plan, Hemeyer said. Otherwise, people just forget. The tragedy spurred the University of Texas at Austin to distribute step-by-step safety procedures if students, faculty and staff encounter someone who is armed or disruptive. The lengthy procedures, which were included in a campuswide memo from UT President William Powers Jr., had been in process for some time, said Robin Gerrow, director of public affairs at University of Texas in Austin. But UT quickly finished up the project and distributed the information after the violence in Virginia, she said.

CONTEXT	 Czech central bank raises interest rate to 3.25 percent The Czech National Bank raised its key interest rate to 3.25 percent Thursday, taking markets by surprise. The Czech Statistics Office earlier announced a 7.4 percent rise in average monthly wage levels in the second quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2006. Czech annual inflation rate fell slightly to 2.3 percent in July from 2.5 percent in June. Despite Thursday's increase to a five-year high, the cost of borrowing in the Czech Republic remained lower than in the 13-nation eurozone, where the key rate is currently 4.0 percent. Rates were last hiked by the national bank in July by a quarter percentage point following on from a similar hike in May. Another rise could still be on the cards by the end of the year, analysts "The need for higher rates was clearly marked out by today's news of faster wages rate growth," commented Raiffeisenbank analyst Michal Brozka. "Domestic factors were clearly predominant," underlined David Navratil of the Ceska Sporitelna bank. Elsewhere, financial markets are speculating that major central banks like the US Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank will either lower rates or leave them unchanged when policymakers meet next month.

He sought more death sentences and increased the pay of law enforcement officers by 70 percent. He immediately exposed the corruption of his powerful predecessor, Gen. Nikolai A. Shchelokov. This enforcement blitz was a precursor of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's vast reform effort in the second half of the 1980s, perestroika. At the time, Western analysts said Fedorchuk's tactics dissidents; sharply curbed international telephone calls; and reduced contacts between Soviets and foreigners. In the agency, he cut weekly days off to one from two and required agents to wear uniforms, banning jeans and other Western clothes. Before becoming KGB chairman, Fedorchuk led the KGB in Ukraine. He gained a reputation for ruthless suppression of Ukrainian nationalists. In 1982, Business Week called him "a real thug," counterintelligence service whose name was contracted from From 1943 to 1947, he served in Ukraine with SMERSH, a military Russian words for "death to spies." He continued in intelligence in Soviet-occupied East Germany and in the Soviet Embassy in Vienna. In 1970, Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet Union's top leader before Andropov, appointed Fedorchuk chairman of the KGB in Ukraine.

He continued in the job under Andropov's successor, Konstantin U. Chernenko. Fedorchuk brought an undercover mind-set to the work of the uniformed police. Books and newspaper reports tell of how he once showed up at a police station, disguised in shabby clothes, to see how an average citizen was treated. He asked to see the department head but left after being kept waiting for two hours. What happened to the preoccupied chief went unstated. The Federal Security Service, the main KGB successor agency, announced the death. The Federal Security Service made no mention of survivors.

CONTEXT	 "Well, it is a great year, but the stars are coming because they need it more than ever. Albums don't sell like they used to. And even with the stars, we have a tough fight ahead of us: There's the premiere of `24' and there's football on." These are strange days for traditional music awards shows. The recording industry is reeling, the concert-touring business is in retreat and television audiences have made it quite clear that their fascination lies with shows that create new celebrities, not the ones that honor existing stars. In 2006, "American Idol" hammered the first hour of the Grammy Awards in head-to-head ratings competition. The following year the producers of the grand old awards show responded by reluctantly adding an imitation "Idol" competition component to the broadcast. "Idol" also has sapped the AMAs of one of their defining traits, their proudly populist heritage; when the AMAs started in 1974, it was the show where music-buying fans chose the winners, not some rarefied academy. But if you can't beat them, book them: The AMAs are dotted with past "Idol" contestants, with David Cook, Carrie Underwood, Jordin Sparks, Chris Daughtry and David "It's hard to describe how much things have changed," said Schwartz, who took over as producer of the AMAs in 1974 but retired and became a consulting producer in recent years. "When I started it was Helen Reddy and Lou Rawls and now that seems like a very long time ago when you listen to the music today. But the role of the show is just as different too." This year the stars are rushing to the AMAs and making the most of their stage time, especially with the all-important holiday sales season ramping up. Not only is there a record number of performers, but the broadcast on ABC also will have a bit of a throwback approach by including medleys, that old variety show stand-by. Christina Aguilera, for instance, will open the show Better: A Decade of Hits," which is being sold exclusively with a "sampler" of her new greatest hits album, "Keeps Gettin' through Target stores and the retail giant's Web site and features 10 hits and two new songs. That sort of retail deal is another of sign of the times, especially for veteran artists, such as the Eagles, who are up for the artist of the year award on Sunday night on the strength of their success with "Long Road Out of Eden," which came out in October 2007 and until last week was sold only at Wal-Mart, Sam's Club and the band's Web site. The Eagles will be a rare bird on Sunday night because of combined factors of their age, gender and rock heritage. This show skews very young and female, and if you need a reminder of that, not only will Miley Cyrus be there to likely will be acknowledged with a surprise of some sort during sing, she'll be celebrating her 16th birthday, a fact that very There won't be many guitar heroes on stage (Coldplay, the Fray and the Jonas Brothers are the extent of the live rock for the show) and even less rap, with Kanye West the only pure rapper scheduled, and his new music is clearly straining that description of his sound. Twelve of the 19 announced performers are female, among them Beyonce, Mariah Carey, Pink, Taylor Swift, Leona Lewis, the Pussycat Dolls and Natasha Bedingfield. "There is this feeling now that anything can happen, and it is extraordinary, isn't it? For me to come a show like this, where Annie Lennox is performing and where Aretha Franklin is here, well that's just amazing to think about because these are people I've admired my whole life," said the British singer who turns 27 next week. "Right now in music it seems to be going back to Perhaps, but veterans also see more frantic urgency. John Ivey, the program director of KIIS-FM, the L.A. Top 40 powerhouse, said that he noticed at the recent Country Music Awards that there were fewer awards and more performances. "The AMAs are doing the same thing. ... I think now when the lighting strikes, that's where the spotlight goes quicker. It's the digital marketplace too, fans are all about singles, not albums, and they burn Expect the cameras to linger on the air-kisses sent back-and- forth between Aguilera and Carey, who will be sitting a few feet apart in the center of the front row. They had a nasty feud in 2006 that played out in the fascinating Kabuki of passive aggressive news releases. Why would these stars subject themselves to this red-carpet ordeal? For some, there are many reasons, but chief among them is that holiday shopping season is right around the corner. Klein said that for the AMAs, now closing in on their 40th year, the hits might change but the song remains the same. "The stars need us right now, maybe more than ever. And we have always needed them."

CONTEXT	 Theater of the absurd: Minnesota bars thwart smoking ban by declaring everyone an actor All the world's a stage at some of Minnesota's bars. A new state ban on smoking in restaurants and other nightspots contains an exception for performers in theatrical productions. So some bars are getting around the ban by printing up playbills, encouraging customers to come in costume, and pronouncing them "actors." The customers are playing right along, merrily puffing away -- and sometimes speaking in funny accents and doing a little improvisation, too. The state Health Department is threatening to bring the curtain down on these sham productions. But for now, it's on with the show. At The Rock, a hard-rock and heavy-metal bar in suburban St. Paul, the "actors" during "theater night" do little more than sit around, drink, smoke and listen to the earsplitting music. "They're playing themselves before Oct. 1. You know, before there was a smoking ban," owner Brian Bauman explained. Shaping the words in the air with his hands, like a producer envisioning the marquee, he said: "We call the production, `Before the Ban!'" The smoking ban, passed by the Legislature last year, allows actors to light up in character during theatrical performances as long as patrons are notified in advance. About 30 bars in Minnesota have been exploiting the loophole by staging the faux theater productions and pronouncing cigarettes props, according to an anti-smoking group. "It's too bad they didn't put as much effort into protecting their employees from smoking," grumbled Jeanne Weigum, executive director of the Association for Nonsmokers. The Health Department this week vowed to begin cracking down on theater nights with fines of as much as $10,000 (euro6,528). "The law was enacted to protect Minnesotans from the serious health effects of secondhand smoke," Minnesota Health Commissioner Sanne Magnan said. "It is time for the curtain to fall on these theatrics." At The Rock earlier this week, a black stage curtain covered part of the entrance, and a sign next to it with an arrow read, "Stage Entrance." Along the opposite wall, below a sign saying "Props Dept.," was a stack of the only props needed: black ashtrays. At the door was a printed playbill for that night's program, with a list of names of the people portraying bartenders and security guards. Playing the owner: "Brian." Courtney Conk paid $1 for a button that said "Act Now" and pinned it to her shirt. That made her an actor for the night, entitling her to smoke. She turned in an understated, minimalist performance, sitting with cigarette in hand and talking to a bass player with the band. "I thought it was funny that they found a loophole," Conk said. "I'm more of an activist-actor tonight, you could say. I think it's kind of this way of saying what we think about the ban." While The Rock asks nothing of its actors by way of creativity, a few other bars have been a little more theatrical. At Barnacles Resort and Campground along Lake Mille Lacs, a "traveling tobacco troupe" dressed in medieval costume on the first theater night. Mark Benjamin, a lawyer who pushed bars to exploit the loophole, wore tights, a feathered cap and black "Hey, I'm a child of the '60s. I can do a little improv," he said. His improv amounted to speaking in medieval character to other patrons. In Hill City, Mike's Uptown owner Lisa Anderson has been offering theater night once a week. The bar had a Mardi Gras theme last Saturday, attracting about 30 patrons, most of them in costume. "I was dressed in a Victorian dress with the old fluffy thing that weighs 500 pounds," she said. "We had some fairies and some pirates and a group of girls -- I'm not sure what they were, but they had big boas and flashy makeup." Though there were no skits, Anderson said some people "start talking with different accents." She added: "It's turned into the funnest thing I can imagine." One bar on northern Minnesota's Iron Range, the Queen City Sports Place, calls its nightly smokefest "The Tobacco Monologues." Proving anew there's no business like show business, Anderson said her theater-night receipts have averaged $2,000 (euro1,305.57) -- up from $500 (euro326.39) right after the ban kicked in. Similarly, Bauman said revenue at The Rock dropped off 30 percent after the ban took effect, then shot back up to normal once the bar began allowing smoking again. He and other bar owners said they plan to continue putting on theater nights. "There's no question we were struggling," he said. "And we are extremely nervous that this is going to go away, and we will be back to the way it was."

However a Tanzanian foreign ministry official said Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party would come under pressure to open talks with the MDC, whose leader Morgan Tsvangirai was among those beaten after South Africa, a critic of what it calls "megaphone diplomacy", has also been trying to push for talks among the rival sides on the basis that only dialogue among the "main political protagonists" could bring about a lasting solution. Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa likened Zimbabwe last week to "a sinking Titanic" but insisted it was not for others outside the region to interfere. "I wish to state categorically that the Zambian government excludes the direct or indirect involvement of any foreign state which is not a SADC member," he said. Archishop Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel prize for his campaigning against apartheid in South Africa, has also said that African leaders should "hold our heads in shame for allowing what According to Azaveeli Rwaitama, a political scientist in the University of Dar es Salaam, it would be a mistake for the Zimbabwean opposition to count on the SADC leaders to help push out Mugabe. President Jakaya Kikwete, will also feature talks on the African Development Community (SADC), hosted by Tanzanian situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but the main focus is expected to be on the recent unrest in Zimbabwe. "I think the moment has come to realise the policy of quiet diplomacy has not produced results ... It has not changed Robert Mugabe's behaviour in any way," said Christopher Dell, the US ambassador to Harare.

CONTEXT	 Rugby League: Storm batter Raiders for big NRL win Premiership favourites Melbourne Storm overpowered the lowly Canberra Raiders 32-16 in Australia's National Rugby League on Saturday. The Raiders led for 38 minutes before the Storm hit top gear to clear away for their second win of the new season after losing to the Brisbane Broncos in last season's grand final. A storm lashed the ground 10 minutes before kick-off and rain bucketed down on the players during the warm-up and for periods during the match.

CONTEXT	A team jointly led by Richard Houlston of Britain's Institute of  Cancer Research and Christopher Amos at the University of Texas found that an extra copy of two critical genetic variants increased the chances that current or former smokers would Chanock of the US National Cancer Institute and David Hunter of In a comment, also published in Nature, epidemiologists Stephen Harvard University caution that the divergence interpretations shows that further, large-scale studies are needed. While they all finger the same culprit, however, the studies disagree on whether the genetic glitch -- shared by 50 percent of the population -- increases the risk of cancer by itself, or only in people who smoke. They also differed on whether, the rogue gene simply enhanced the addictive quality of tobacco among smokers or provoked cancer- causing chemical reactions in the lungs. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with more than one million new cases every year. Nature, "give us new targets for both the prevention and the Taken together the studies, published in the British journal treatment of lung cancer," said Nora Volkow, director of Britain's National Institute on Drug Abuse. The three papers also highlight the growing importance of new tools that allow researchers to sift through huge swathes of the human genome in search of tiny variants linked to specific The basic technique, made possible only recently by improvements in computing power, is to compare the genetic profiles of thousands -- or tens of thousands -- of people with a specific disease against the profile of healthy people, looking for tell- With two extra copies, the added risk among the subjects studied -- some 3,800 smokers of European descent in Texas and Britain, half of them cancer patients -- jumped to 80 percent. The cancer-causing genetic snippets are on chromosome 15, involving a molecular swap in just one of the three billion chemical "base pairs" that comprise the building blocks of the human genome. Both smokers and non-smokers have a 50-50 chance of carrying them, he noted, but "they only increase the risk of lung cancer in people who have smoked." A second study, led by Kari Stefansson of deCODE Genetics in Iceland, incriminated the same bit of genetic code, called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), but reached the opposite The genetic analysis of 10,000 smokers in Iceland showed that the offending SNP was more common in heavy smokers that among light smokers or non-smokers, leading the researchers to conclude that Earlier studies have shown that the same part of the chromosome that lodges rs1051730 also encodes nicotine receptors expressed in lung and lung-cancer cells. The third study, led by Paul Brennan of the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, supported the other two in drawing a strong link between the disease and rs1051730, saying the genetic variant accounted for 14 percent of all lung cancer cases. But it differed from the others in finding a statistically similar risk of contracting the disease regardless of whether one smokes or not. "These are the first genome-wide association studies to attempt to identify the genetic component of a disease that has such an overwhelmingly strong environmental cause," they write.
